PREFACE

Booklets under the ‘Tax Payers Information Series’
are published as a part of the endeavour of the Income Tax
Department to increase the awareness of the taxpayers
about the provisions of tax laws and the steps taken by
the government to reduce the complexities of tax laws and
to improve Tax Payer Service. The updated edition of the
Tax Payers Information Series booklet titled “Valuation
of Perquisites” will assist a large number of salaried tax
payers in computing their tax liability correctly.

It is felt that in many cases, neither the employers
nor their employees are aware about the includability of
the value of various perquisites in the total income of the
employees. In some cases, employers and employees are not
aware as to how to correctly value the perquisites. Efforts
have been made to address all such issues in this Booklet.
The author Sh. Parneet Singh Sachdev, Pr.DIT(Inv.),
Ludhiana has taken keen interest in updating the edition
and the book is vetted by Sh. Jagdeep Goel, CIT(A)-1,
Gurugram. We thank them both for their efforts.

We are hopeful that readers will find this publication
quite useful. The Directorate of Income tax (Public Relations,
Printing & Publicity) welcomes any suggestion to further

improve this publication.
