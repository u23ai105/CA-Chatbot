2001 census is 10 lakh or below. In case
the accommodation provided is not owned
by the employer, but is taken on lease
or rent, then the value of the perquisite
would be the actual amount of lease rent
paid/payable by the employer or 15% of
salary, whichever is lower. In both of above
cases, the value of the perquisite would be
reduced by the rent, if any, actually paid by
the employee.

Value of Furnished Accommodation- The
value would be the value of unfurnished
accommodation as computed above,
increased by 10% per annum of the cost of
furniture (including TV/radio/ refrigerator/
AC/other gadgets). In case such furniture
is hired from a third party, the value of
unfurnished accommodation would be
increased by the hire charges paid/payable
by the employer. However, any payment
recovered from the employee towards the
above would be reduced from this amount.
