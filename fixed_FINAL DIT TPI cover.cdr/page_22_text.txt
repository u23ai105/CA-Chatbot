Proceedings before the Tribunal to be open to public:

Normally the proceedings in the Tribunal are public except
in cases decided to be otherwise by the Tribunal as per its
discretion.

ORDERS OF THE APPELLATE TRIBUNAL:

Normally appeals are heard by a Bench comprising one
judicial member and one accountant member. Appeals where
total income computed by the Assessing Officer does not exceed
Rs. 5 lakh may be disposed of by single member Bench. The
President of ITAT is empowered to constitute Special Bench
consisting of three or more than three members for disposal of
any particular case, one of whom would necessarily be a judicial
member and one an accountant member. If the members of the
Bench differ in opinion on any point, decision is by majority. If
members are equally divided in their opinion, the points of
difference are stated by each member and the case is referred
by the President of the ITAT for hearing such points by one or
more of other members of the ITAT. Such point or points is
decided according to opinion of majority of the members of ITAT
who heard the case, including those who first heard it. The
Bench normally pronounces its orders in Court. Where the orders
are not pronounced in the Court, list of such orders showing
results of appeal and signed by members is put on the notice
board of the Bench.
