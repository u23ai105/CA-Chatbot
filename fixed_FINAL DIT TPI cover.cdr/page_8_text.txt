INTRODUCTION

One Law Dictionary defines ‘appeal’ as a proceeding taken to
rectify an erroneous decision of a court by submitting the
question to a higher court, or court of appeal. Right to appeal
under income tax law is a creation of statute and not an inherent
right. Appeal can be filed only against orders listed in the Income
Tax Act and not any order. Income tax liability is determined at
the level of Assessing Officer first. A tax payer aggrieved by
various actions of Assessing Officer can appeal before
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). Further appeal can be
preferred before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. On
substantial question of law, further appeal can be filed before the
High Court and even to the Supreme Court.
