appellate order, which it may wish to rely upon. The paper book
duly indexed and page numbered is to be filed at least a day
before the hearing of the appeal along-with proof of service of
copy of the same on the other side at least a week before. The
Bench may in appropriate cases condone the delay and admit the
paper book. The Tribunal can also, on its own direct preparation
of paper book in triplicate by and at the cost of appellant or the
respondent as it may consider necessary for disposal of appeal.
Each paper in the paper book is to be certified as true copy by
the party filing the same. Additional evidence, if any, should not
be part of the paper book and it should be filed separately.

Hearing of the appeal:

The Appellate Tribunal fixes the date for hearing the appeal
and notifies the parties specifying date and place of hearing of
the appeal. A copy of memorandum of appeal is sent to the
respondent either before or along with such notice. The appeal
is heard on the date fixed and on other dates to which it may be
adjourned. If the appellant does not appear in person or through
an authorized representative when appeal is called on for hearing,
the ITAT may dispose of the appeal on merits after hearing the
respondent. However, where after disposal of appeal ex parte,
the appellant appears afterwards and satisfies the Tribunal that
there was sufficient cause for non appearance, the Tribunal can
set aside the ex parte order and restore the appeal. Similar
procedure is applicable where appeal is disposed in the absence
of respondent.

Production of additional evidence before the Tribunal:

The parties to the appeal are not entitled to produce
additional evidence of any kind, either oral or documentary
before the Tribunal. However, if the Tribunal requires production
