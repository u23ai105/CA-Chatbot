APPEAL BEFORE HIGH COURT

Appeal against Appellate Tribunal’s order lies with the High
Court, Where the High Court is satisfied that the case involves
a substantial question of law. Appeal to the High Court against
Appellate Tribunal’s order can be filed by the tax payer or the
Chief Commissioner/Commissioner within 120 days of receipt
of the order and in the form of memorandum of appeal, precisely
stating the substantial question of law involved. If the High Court
is satisfied that a substantial question is involved, it would
formulate that question. High Court hears the appeal only on the
question of law so formulated; however, the respondents can
argue at the time of hearing that case does not involve such
question of law. Appeal filed before High Court is heard by
bench of not less than two Judges and decision is by majority.
