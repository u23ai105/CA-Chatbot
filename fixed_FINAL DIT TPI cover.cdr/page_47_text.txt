appeal pertaining to the same assessment year is pending
before the AAC concerned. The Tribunal should be
informed immediately after the disposal of the said quantum
appeal by the AAC. If he said quantum appeal has already
been disposed of by the AAC at the time of filing of the
penalty appeal before the Tribunal, the date of filing of the
quantum appeal before the Tribunal may be intimated to
enable it to link both the appeals and post them for hearing
on one date. In case no such quantum appeal is proposed
to be filed before the Tribunal, the fact may be intimated to
the Tribunal, so that the penalty appeal may be posted for
hearing.
