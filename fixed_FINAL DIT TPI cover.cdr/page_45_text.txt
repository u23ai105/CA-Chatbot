made. Unless rule 10 is complied with, it is not ordinarily
possible to go outside the record. An application for time for
filing an affidavit as required by rule 10 at the time of
hearing of the appeal will not ordinarily be granted. The
object of this suggestion is to save time in hearing and
deciding appeals, applications and cross-objections.

7. Ifan appeal/reference application/cross-objection is barred
by time, or if there are reasons for believing that it may
be barred by time, an application for condoning the delay
should be made well in advance before the hearing of the
appeal/application/cross-objection. Such an application
should ordinarily be supported by an affidavit and other
documentary evidence, as for example, a medical certificate.

8. Three copies (typed, if possible) of the statements made
by the assessee or the witnesses or of documents relied
upon or of extracts of accounts, where necessary, should be
produced at the time of the hearing of the, appeal,
application or cross-objection. As far as possible, all such
documents and papers should be in English or translated into
English. This suggestion has been accepted by many
solicitors and auditors appearing before the Tribunal. This
suggestion is intended to facilitate the hearing of the appeal,
application or cross-objection. Extracts of accounts
should, if possible, be certified by the assesseeâ€™s
representative or by any other reliable person and be in
English.

9. Books of account should be kept handy at the time of
hearing of the appeal, application or cross objection.
If books of account of the year preceding or succeeding
year of account are relevant, they should also be kept
handy.
