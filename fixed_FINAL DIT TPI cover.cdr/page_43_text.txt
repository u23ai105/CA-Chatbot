Annexure-5

The Appellate Tribunal has, vide F: No. 114-Ad(AT)/69, dated
13-4-1970, laid down the following guidelines for the guidance of
the assesses and their representatives:

1. In all communications addressed to the Tribunal by the
parties with regard to appeals or applications or cross-
objections the number thereof, or, if the number is not
known, the date of filing thereof, should invariably be given.
Failure to furnish the information will cause avoidable
correspondence and needless delay in answering
correspondence.

2. An application for adjournment of the hearing should be
made at the earliest possible time. If it could be presented
personally, it should be done so. If it cannot be presented
personally, a stamped envelope with the address of the
assesses or his representative should, as far as possible,
accompany the application. If a reply is required
telegraphically, the necessary postage stamps should
accompany the application. Ifa telegram is sent asking for
adjournment, arrangement should be made for a reply-paid
telegram. The suggestion made in this paragraph is intended
not so much as a measure of economy as a measure for
greater efficiency. The Tribunal is not bound to reply to
applications for adjournment. Replies will, however, be given
as far as possible. Unless the assesses hears that his
application for adjournment has been granted, he should
remain present at the hearing of the appeal or application or
cross-objection, as the case may be.
