10. Assessees should, as far as possible, be present at the
hearing of the appeal, application or cross objection. This
suggestion is made entirely in the interest of the assessees.

11. It has been noticed that requests are made to block the
appeals to await decision of the High Court or the Supreme
Court in â€˜similar points involved in the appeals. In order to
avoid multiplicity in proceedings, the Appellate Tribunal
acceded to such request. It is, however, found that in many
of such cases, the particulars of the case involving the
identical points are not on record so as to find out whether
that case has been disposed of by the High Court/ the
Supreme Court or not. This results in prolonging
correspondence between the Tribunal and the parties
causing long and avoidable delay in the disposal of those
blocked appeals/applications/cross-objections. It is, therefore,
suggested that an application for keeping the appeals/
applications/cross-objections blocked should invariably furnish
the particulars of the case pending with the High Court/the
Supreme Court involving identical points for which the
appeals or applications or cross-objections are sought to be
blocked. The assesses and the departmental representatives
should inform the Tribunal about the disposal of the case by
the High Court or the Supreme Court immediately after its
disposal so as to enable the Tribunal to dispose of such
blocked cases soon thereafter. In this connection, it may be
made clear that the Tribunal is not bound to keep such
appeals/applications/cross-objections blocked for indefinite
periods.

the IAC is filed, the appellant should invariably inform the
Tribunal in the forwarding letter whether any quantum
