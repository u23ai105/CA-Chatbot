APPEAL PROCEDURE:

On receipt of Form no. 35, Commissioner of Income-tax
(Appeals) fixes date and place for hearing the appeal
by issuing notice to the tax payer and the Assessing Officer,
against whose order appeal is preferred. The tax payer has
a right to be heard either personally or through an Authorized
Representative. The Commissioner (Appeals) would hear the
appeal and may adjourn it from time to time till the hearing is
over. During hearing, Commissioner (Appeals) may allow the tax
payer to go into additional grounds of appeal, i.e. grounds not
specified in the appeal memo, i.e. Form no. 35, on being satisfied
that omission of those grounds from the form of appeal was not
wilful or unreasonable. Before disposing of any appeal,
Commissioner (Appeals) may carry out further enquiry himself
or through the Assessing Officer. If such proceedings are
conducted through the Assessing officer, the same are generally
referred to as remand proceedings.

FILING OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE:

During appeal proceedings, the tax payer is not entitled to
produce any evidence, whether oral or documentary other than
what was already produced before the Assessing Officer.
Commissioner (Appeals) would admit additional evidence filed
only in following situations:
