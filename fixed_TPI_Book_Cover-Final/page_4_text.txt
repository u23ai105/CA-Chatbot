PREFACE

The provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to “Tax
Deduction at source (TDS) other than Salaries” are of
immense importance in the present scenario when TDS collections
account for almost 39% of total collection of Direct Taxes.

The Income Tax Act provides for penalty and prosecution for
any default in respect of deduction of tax at source or deposit of
the deducted amount in the Government account. Thus, the Tax
Deductors need to be well conversant with the provisions relating
to Tax Deduction at Source as provided in sections 193 to 198 of
the Income Tax Act. This booklet under the TPI Series is an attempt
to put forth the various provisions on the subject in a lucid yet
precise manner.

This book has been authored and updated by Shri Madhukar
K. Bhagat, Addl. DIT (Investigation) (Spl. Cell), New Delhi who
has very painstakingly updated the booklet as per the provisions of
the Law as amended upto Finance Act, 2011. We are grateful to
Shri Bhagat for updating the Booklet. I am sure that this volume
will be appreciated and widely used by the general public.

The Directorate would appreciate any suggestion for further

improvement of the booklet.
