the person extending the loan certifies that such interest is
payable in respect of the amount advanced for acquisition or
construction of the house or as refinance of the principal
amount outstanding under an earlier loan taken for such
acquisition or construction.

The Finance Act 2014 has raised this limit. This interest
payable on self occupied property where constructions or
acquisition is completed within 3 years of the financial year
in which capital is borrowed will be deductible to the extent
of Rs. 2 lakhs. This is applicable from AY 2015-16 (FY
2014-15)

In the above context the following further aspects have to be
kept in view:

1.

If capital is borrowed for any other purpose (e.g. if capital
is borrowed for reconstruction, repairs or renewals of a
house property), then the maximum deduction on account of
interest is Rs.30,000 (and not Rs.1,50,000).

There is no stipulation regarding the date of commencement
of construction. Consequently, the construction of the
residential unit could have commenced before April 1,1999
but, as long as its construction/acquisition is completed
within 3 years, the higher deduction of Rs.1,50,000 (Rs.
2,00,000 w.e.f. AY 2015-2016) would be available. Also,
there is no stipulation regarding the construction/acquisition
of the residential unit being entirely financed by the loan
taken on or after April 1, 1999. It may be so in part.

However, the higher deduction upto Rs.1,50,000 can be
taken for the loan which has been taken and utilized for
construction/acquisition after April 1, 1999. The loan taken
prior to April 1, 1999 will carry deduction of interest upto
Rs. 30,000 only (CBDTâ€™s circular No. 779, dated September
14, 1999).

Rs. 1,50,000 (Rs. 2,00,000 w.e.f. AY 2015-2016) maximum
deduction will not be available in the following situations:

i.

if capital is borrowed before April 1, 1999 for purchase,
construction, reconstruction, repairs or renewals of a
house property;

if capital is borrowed on or after April 1, 1999 for
reconstruction, repairs or renewals of a house property;
and

if capital is borrowed on or after April 1, 1999 but
construction is not completed within 3 years from the
end of the year in which capital was borrowed.

In the above situations only deduction upto Rs. 30,000 can
be claimed.
