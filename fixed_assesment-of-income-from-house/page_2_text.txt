PREFACE

Income from House Property is one of the most important
heads of income under the Income Tax Act. It is one such
subject on which the tax payers in particular have a lot of
queries relating to exemptions, deductions and overall computation
of Income from House Property.

The unique feature of this booklet is, that, besides providing
comprehensive information on the provisions of substantive law
in respect of Income form House property in a simplified
manner, it also includes step by step computation of House
Property Income.

Since this particular head of Income affects a substantial
number of tax payers, this booklet has been revised periodically.
The present edition has been updated to cover the changes in
law brought by the Finance Act, 2014 I am grateful to Smt.
Garima Bhagat, Addl. Director General, Competition Commission
of India, New Delhi who has meticulously revised this edition.

We endeavour to Provide our tax payers a simply & easy
publication to understand the complex tax laws. It is my earnest
hope that the booklet will be found useful by the tax payers. Any
suggestions for its improvement are always welcome.
