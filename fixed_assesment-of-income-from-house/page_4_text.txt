CHAPTERI

INTRODUCTION

Section 4 of the Income tax Act 1961 (Act hereinafter) provides
for charge of income tax. However, this section
by itself does not create any liability. It has been observed
by the Supreme Court in CIT Vs. K. Srinivasan (1972) 83
ITR 346-351 that although section 4 is the charging section, yet
income tax can be charged only when the central Act, which
normally is the Finance Act, enacts that income tax shall be
charged for any assessment year at the rate or rates specified
therein.

Every money receipt by a person is not chargeable to tax.
Section 14 of the Act specifies five heads of income on which
tax can be imposed under the Income tax Act. In order to be
chargeable, an income has to be brought under one of these
five heads. The heads are (i) salaries (ii) Income from House
property (iii) profits and gains of business or profession
(iv) capital gains and (v) income from other sources. In the
discussion to follow, the relevant provisions of the
Act relating to Income from House Property would be
considered and how the computation of income from this
source is to be made, namely, how the income is to be
worked out and what are the deductions to be given for
computing the taxable income shall be explained. Sections 22
to 27 of the Act deal with the subject of taxation of income
from house property.
