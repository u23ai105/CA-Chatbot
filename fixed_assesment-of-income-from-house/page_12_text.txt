CHAPTER III

COMPUTATION OF INCOME FROM
SELF OCCUPIED PROPERTY

As mentioned earlier, where a person has occupied more
than one house for residential purposes, only one house, as
chosen by him will be treated as ‘self occupied’ and all other
houses will be deemed to be let out and the income from such
houses would be computed as indicated earlier. In regard to
one house treated as used for own residential purposes
throughout the year, Section 23 (2) (a) prescribes that annual
value of such house shall be taken to be nil, if the conditions
mentioned below are satisfied:

a. the property (or part thereof) is not actually let during
whole (or any part) of the previous year; and

b. no other benefit is derived therefrom

Interest on borrowed capital for self occupied property
The maximum amount of interest permissible in cases of

self-occupied property is Rs.1,50,000 (in respect of funds

borrowed on or after 01.04.1999). Interest upto Rs.1,50,000 is

deductible if the following conditions are satisfied:

* capital is borrowed on or after April 1, 1999 for
acquiring or constructing a property;

3 years from the end of the financial year in which
capital was borrowed; and
