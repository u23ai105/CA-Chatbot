13 ORDERS OF THE ITAT

Normally appeals are heard by a Bench comprising one
judicial member and one accountant member. Appeals
where total income computed by the Assessing Officer
does not exceed Rs. 5 lakh may be disposed of by a single
member Bench. The Bench normally pronounces its
orders in Court. Where the orders are not pronounced in
the Court, list of such orders showing results of appeal
and signed by members is put on the notice board of the
Bench.

If the members of a Bench differ in opinion on any point,
decision is by majority. If members are equally divided
in their opinion, the points of difference are stated by
each member and the case is referred by the President of
the ITAT for hearing such points to one or more of other
members of the ITAT. Such points are decided according
to opinion of majority of the members of ITAT, who heard
the case, including those who first heard it.

On certain issues, which involve different interpretation
by different branches of ITAT, the President of ITAT is
empowered to constitute a Special Bench consisting of
three or more members, one of whom is necessarily to be
a judicial member and one an accountant member.
