be filed by the tax payer or the Chief Commissioner/
Commissioner within 120 days of receipt of the order
and in the form of memorandum of appeal, precisely
stating the substantial question of law involved. If the
High Court is satisfied that a substantial question
is involved, it would formulate that question. High
Court hears the appeal only on the question of law so
formulated; however, the respondents can argue at the
time of hearing that case does not involve such question
of law. Appeal filed before High Court is heard by bench
of not less than two Judges and decision is by majority.

the Supreme Court under Art. 136 of the constitution of
India against the order of the High Court.
