is, however, found that in many of such cases, the
particulars of the case involving the identical points
are not on record so as to find out whether that case
has been disposed of by the High Court/ the Supreme
Court or not. This results in prolonging correspondence
between the Tribunal and the parties causing long
and avoidable delay in the disposal of those blocked
appeals /applications/cross-objections. It is, therefore,

suggested that an application for keeping the appeals/
applications/cross-objections blocked should invariably
furnish the particulars of the case pending with the High
Court/the Supreme Court involving identical points for
which the appeals or applications or cross-objections are
sought to be blocked. The assesses and the departmental
representatives should inform the Tribunal about the
disposal of the case by the High Court or the Supreme
Court immediately after its disposal so as to enable the
Tribunal to dispose of such blocked cases soon thereafter.
In this connection, it may be made clear that the Tribunal
is not bound to keep such appeals/applications/cross-
objections blocked for indefinite periods.
