annul the order of the CIT(Appeals) and thereby can delete
or reduce the quantum of demand, however, ITAT cannot
enhance the demand. Importantly, ITAT is the final fact-
finding authority.

Income Tax appeals against the orders passed by ITAT
can be filed by either of the parties before the respective
High Courts of judicature (the third level of appellate
authority). However, generally, an appeal before a
High Court is admitted only if it involves a substantial
question of law. Supreme Court, which lays down final
interpretation of law on an issue, can be approached by
either of the parties against the order of a High Courts,
albeit again, only on a question of law.

Besides the above appellate mechanism, an Alternative
Dispute Resolution mechanism in the form of the Income
Tax Settlement Commission is available, which can be
approached by a taxpayer before an assessment order
is passed by the Assessing officer, subject to meeting
certain conditions. Further, A foreign company or
any taxpayer intending to enter into an international
transaction, may approach the Authority for Advance
Ruling(AAR) for obtaining final ruling on an issue, before
the dispute arises.

Functional independence and objective decision-making
is an important hallmark of the Income tax appellate
mechanism. Both ITAT and the CIT(Appeals), despite
being under the administrative control of Ministry of law
