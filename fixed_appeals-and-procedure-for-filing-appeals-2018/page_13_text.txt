and the Ministry of Finance, respectively, are governed
by the principle of judicial hierarchy. All appellate
authorities are bound by the decision of the Supreme
Court on a question of law. In the absence of a contrary
decision of Supreme Court, the jurisdictional ITAT and
the CIT(Appeals) are bound by the decision of the High
Court of judicature. In the absence of any decision of
the High Court of judicature in respect of an ITAT
bench and corresponding CIT(Appeals), the decision
of any High Court on a question of law would have
binding precedence. On identical facts, CIT(Appeals) in a
jurisdiction are bound by the decision of the jurisdictional
ITAT, provided there is no contrary decision of Supreme
Court or of any of the High Courts.

Taxpayers not only have a right to appeal and get a
decision in independent and objective manner, but
also have a right to get prompt effect by the Income
tax authorities to the outcome of an appeal order. The
Citizen’s Charter of the Income Tax Department lays
down service delivery standards of highest standard, by
which Income tax authorities are committed to give effect
to the appeal order and issue refund to the taxpayer
within one month. If the income tax authorities fail to
give effect to the appeal order, taxpayers can approach
public grievance officers, details of whom are available
on the income tax department’s website. Such grievances
are to be redressed within 2 months.
