PREFACE

It has been a continuous endeavor of the Income
Tax department to provide quality taxpayer services. This
booklet under the “Tax Payer Information Series” is an
attempt to make taxpayers aware about the provisions
of the Income-tax Act 1961 relating to “Appeals and
Procedure of Filing Appeals” and present procedures,
which is of immense importance now, as more and more
people join the tax net every year. The booklet would be a
guide to taxpayers who may contest the orders passed by
the Income Tax authorities.

The Income tax Department is a front-runner in use
of Information Technology in its core procedures. Recently,
the department has introduced an e-filing facility for filing
of appeal at the first appellate level i.e. the Commissioner
of Income-tax(Appeals). This booklet explains the e-filing
facility in simple user-friendly steps and puts forth in
simple language, the relevant provisions and procedures
under the Income-tax Act relating to filing of appeal before
various Appellate Authorities.

Dr. Dheeraj Bhatnagar, IRS, presently, Joint
Secretary, Department of Investment & Public Assets
Management, Ministry of Finance, New Delhi has very
painstakingly re-written the booklet, by incorporating
the e-filing procedure through the Income Tax Business
Applications module introduced recently and by updating
the content in view of the present provisions of the Law. Shri
Anurag Sharma, Deputy Director of Income tax (Systems)
has vetted the e-filing provisions. I thank them both for
their efforts.
