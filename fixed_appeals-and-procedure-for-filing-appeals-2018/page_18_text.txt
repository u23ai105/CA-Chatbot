as a separate Ground of appeal. The grounds of
appeal can challenge the action of the Income tax
authority on a question of law or on a question of
fact. For example, in an appeal against addition
to the returned income by applying a gross profit
rate on estimated turnover, the appellant may

present the ground of appeal as under:

“The Ld. Assessing Officer was not justified in rejecting the
results as per regular books of account and in estimating

the income by applying an ad-hoc rate of gross profit.”

4. WHO CAN SIGN AND VERIFY FORM NO. 35?

The form of appeal, the grounds of appeal and the form
of verification are to be signed and verified by the person
authorized to sign the return of income under section
140 as applicable to the taxpayer. In other words, form
of appeal is to be signed and verified by following:

(1) In case of appeal by an individual taxpayer, by
the individual taxpayer himself or by a person
duly authorised by him who is holding a valid
power of attorney.

(2) In case of a Hindu Undivided Family, by the Karta
of the family or if Karta is absent from India or
is not capable for signing, by any other adult
member of such family.
