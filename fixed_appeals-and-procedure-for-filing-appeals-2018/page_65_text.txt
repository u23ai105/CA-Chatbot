is not bound to reply to applications for adjournment.
Replies will, however, be given as far as possible. Unless
the assesses hears that his application for adjournment
has been granted, he should remain present at the
hearing of the appeal or application or cross-objection,
as the case may be.

3. Whenever an appeal or application or cross-
objection is filed which is connected with an appeal or
application or cross-objection relating to the same party
filed earlier, reference thereto should invariably be given
with the latter appeal or application or cross-objection
so that the various connected appeals or applications
or cross-objections could be linked up together. This
will be for the convenience of the parties themselves. If
any practitioner wishes that appeals and applications
and cross-objections relating to different assessees in
which he is engaged should be taken up on the same or
consecutive days, he should intimate to the Tribunal the
particulars of these appeals and applications and cross-
objections including the dates of filing thereof, well in
advance.

4. An application for an early hearing for an appeal
should invariably give detailed reasons why the assesses
wants that his appeal should be given preference over
the appeals made by other assesses. The application
should also state whether or not the tax has been paid
and, if so, to what extent.
