appeal has already been disposed of by the AAC at the
time of filing of the penalty appeal before the Tribunal,
the date of filing of the quantum appeal before the
Tribunal may be intimated to enable it to link both the
appeals and post them for hearing on one date. In case
no such quantum appeal is proposed to be filed before
the Tribunal, the fact may be intimated to the Tribunal,
so that the penalty appeal may be posted for hearing.
