dates to which it may be adjourned. If the appellant
does not appear in person or through an authorized
representative when appeal is called on for hearing, the
ITAT may dispose of the appeal on merits after hearing
the respondent. However, where after disposal of appeal
ex parte, the appellant appears afterwards and satisfies
the Tribunal that there was sufficient cause for non-
appearance, the Tribunal can set aside the ex parte order
and restore the appeal. Similar procedure is applicable
where appeal is disposed in the absence of respondent.

FILING OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

The parties to the appeal are not entitled to produce
additional evidence of any kind, either oral or documentary
before the Tribunal. However, if the Tribunal requires
production of any document, examination of any witness
or filing of any affidavit to enable it to pass orders, it
may allow such document to be produced, witness to be
examined, affidavit to be filed and such evidence to be
adduced.

PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE ITAT TO BE OPEN TO
PUBLIC

Normally the proceedings in the Tribunal are public
except in cases decided to be otherwise by the Tribunal

as per its discretion.
