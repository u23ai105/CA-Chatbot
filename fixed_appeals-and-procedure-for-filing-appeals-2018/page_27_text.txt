issuing notice to the tax payer. A copy of the notice is
also sent to the Assessing Officer, against whose order
appeal is preferred or to whom the jurisdiction over the
appellant has been later got transferred. The scheduling
of hearings by the Commissioner (Appeals) is to be
made in accordance with the CBDTs annual policy for
litigation management, which gives differential priority
to different categories of appeals. E.g., High demand
appeals (involving demand above Rupees Ten lakhs or
assessments involving addition of over Rs Fifty lakhs),
which are carried forward for more than 12 months as on
the 1st April of the current year are given highest priority.

(iv) During the hearing before the CIT(Appeals), the
tax payer has a right to be heard either personally or
through an Authorized Representative. However, where
an authorized representative is to appear before the
ClT(Appeals), a written authorization duly signed by the
authorized signatory on a stamp paper is to be produced
before the CIT(Appeals), at the time of hearing. Before
the hearing, the Commissioner (Appeals) will also issue a
copy of the notice to the assessing officer and allow him
to represent the income tax department and respond on
the SOF or grounds of appeal or further written or oral
submissions filed by the taxpayer during the hearings.
On the request of the appellant, the CIT(Appeals) may
also allow the tax payer to file additional grounds of
appeal, i.e. grounds not specified in the Form no. 35,
after satisfying himself that omission of those grounds
from the form of appeal was not willful or unreasonable.
