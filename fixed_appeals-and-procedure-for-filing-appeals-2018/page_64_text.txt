ANNEXURE-5S
ITAT GUIDELINES

The Appellate Tribunal has, vide F. No. 114-Ad(AT)/69,
dated 13-4-1970, laid down the following guidelines for
the guidance of the assesses and their representatives:

1. In all communications addressed to the Tribunal
by the parties with regard to appeals or applications or
cross-objections the number thereof, or, if the number is
not known, the date of filing thereof, should invariably
be given. Failure to furnish the information will cause
avoidable correspondence and needless delay in
answering correspondence.

2. An application for adjournment of the hearing
should be made at the earliest possible time. If it could
be presented personally, it should be done so. If it cannot
be presented personally, a stamped envelope with the
address of the assesses or his representative should, as
far as possible, accompany the application. If a reply is
required telegraphically, the necessary postage stamps
should accompany the application. If a telegram is sent
asking for adjournment, arrangement should be made
for a reply-paid telegram. The suggestion made in this
paragraph is intended not so much as a measure of
economy as a measure for greater efficiency. The Tribunal
