demand will be valid up to the disposal of appeal by the
last appellate authority. Further, filing of appeal itself
does not stop the assessing officer from making recovery
of demand, unless specifically stayed by an Income tax
authority on the request of the taxpayer.

9. TIME PERIOD WITHIN WHICH APPEAL CAN BE
FILED BEFORE COMMISSIONER (APPEALS)

Appeal before a CIT(A) is to be filed within 30 days of the
date of service of notice of demand relating to assessment
or penalty order or within 30 days of the date of service
of any other order sought to be appealed against, as the
case may be. The Commissioner (Appeals) may however,
condone the delay and admit an appeal filed after the
expiration of period of 30 days, if he is satisfied that there
was sufficient cause for not presenting the appeal within
the prescribed time. For this purpose, an Application for
condoning the delay citing reasons for the delay along
with necessary evidences should be filed with Form No.
35 at the time of filing of appeal.
