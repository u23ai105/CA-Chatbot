5. An application for sending for the case of another
assesses should also be made at the earliest possible
opportunity. Cases will not ordinarily be sent for, for the
purpose of making an assessment on the same basis in
other cases.

6. Attention is invited to rule 10 of the Appellate
Tribunal Rules, 1963. That rule provides that where
a fact which cannot be borne out by or is contrary to
record is alleged, it should be stated clearly and concisely
and should be supported by a duly sworn affidavit.
Complaints are at times made before the Tribunal that
certain statements attributed to the assessees or their
representatives were in fact not made. Unless rule
10 is complied with, it is not ordinarily possible to go
outside the record. An application for time for filing an
affidavit as required by rule 10 at the time of hearing of
the appeal will not ordinarily be granted. The object of
this suggestion is to save time in hearing and deciding
appeals, applications and cross-objections.

7. If an  appeal/reference  application/cross-
objection is barred by time, or if there are reasons for
believing that it may be barred by time, an application
for condoning the delay should be made well in advance
before the hearing of the appeal/application/cross-
objection. Such an application should ordinarily be
supported by an affidavit and other documentary
evidence, as for example, a medical certificate.
