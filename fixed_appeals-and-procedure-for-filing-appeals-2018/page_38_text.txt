8. MEMORANDUM OF CROSS OBJECTIONS:

On filing of the appeal to the ITAT by the taxpayer or by
the Assessing Officer, the opposite party will be intimated
about the filing of appeal and given an opportunity to file
a memorandum of cross objection with the ITAT, within a
period of 30 days of receipt of notice. The memorandum
of cross objection is to be filed in Form No. 36A. There is
no fee for filing the memorandum of cross objection. The
ITAT may accept a memorandum of cross objection even
after the period of 30 days if it is satisfied that there was
sufficient cause for not submitting the same within the
prescribed time. A person, who is competent to sign the
Form 36 (i.e., form of appeal), can only sign and verify the
memorandum of cross objections. The ITAT will dispose
of the memorandum of cross objections like an appeal.
