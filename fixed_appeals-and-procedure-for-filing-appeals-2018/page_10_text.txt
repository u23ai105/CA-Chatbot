1. INTRODUCTION

The Indian direct tax system provides the taxpayers a
right to grievance redressal in respect of certain specified
orders of income tax authorities by providing a multi-
layered appellate mechanism. The appeal mechanism is
cost-effective with negligible amount of appeal fee involved.
With the introduction of e-filing facility at the first appellate
level, filing of appeal by taxpayers has become much easier
for the taxpayers. Taxpayers can follow the progress of
their appeals through websites of ITAT, High Courts and
the Supreme Court, which display cause lists and provide
portal for ascertaining status of appeals.

The right to appeal under the income tax law is limited
to certain orders passed by the Income tax authorities
specified in the Income Tax Act,1961. Income tax
authorities responsible for making assessment of
income of taxpayers are termed as “Assessing officers”.
Besides, certain income tax authorities are responsible
for verifying whether a person while making certain
specified payment in the nature of interest, commission,
etc. to another person, has deducted correct amount
of tax and deposited it in Government account or not.
These income tax authorities are required to give their
findings by passing written orders. Administratively,
these assessing officers work under the administrative
control of Principal Commissioners of Income tax/
Commissioner of Income tax (Administration).
