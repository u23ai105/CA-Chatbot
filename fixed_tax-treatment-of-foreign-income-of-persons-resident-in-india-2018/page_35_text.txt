Method of exemption :

Under this, the income which according to the
source rule arises in one country is not taxed in the
other country, though it can be taken into account
for purpose of determining the rates of tax.

Method of tax credit :

Under this, the income is taxed in both the countries
in accordance with their respective tax laws read with
the bilateral double taxation avoidance agreements.
However, the country of residence of the taxpayer
allows him credit for the tax charged there on in
the country of source against the tax charged on
such income in the country of residence. Credit is
also to be given for the tax that would have been
paid but for certain tax incentives, if the bilateral
tax agreements so provide.

5.3.2 Essentially, the difference between the exemption
method and the credit method is that the former looks at
income and the latter looks at tax on income.

5.3.3. To see whether exemption income is to be allowed
or credit system, one must look at the particular DTAA
involved. If the DTAA says that a particular income
shall be taxed only in source/resident country, it means
that the income cannot be taxed by the other country.
However, if the DTAA says that the income may be
taxed in source country, it means that both source
and resident country have the right to tax that income.
