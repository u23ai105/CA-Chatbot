CATEGORIES OF RESIDENTS

2.5 Residents are divided into two categories (a)
resident and ordinarily resident, and (b) resident but
not ordinarily resident. The status of ‘resident but not
ordinarily resident’ is available only to the individuals
and Hindu undivided families.

Who is a resident but not ordinarily resident?

2.6 An individual is said to be a “not ordinarily
resident” in India in any financial year if:

(a) he has been a non-resident in India in nine out of
ten financial years preceding that year; or

(b) he has been in India for a period of 729 days or less
during the seven financial years preceding that
year.

Thus an individual would be a “not ordinarily
resident” (NOR) if he fulfils either of the aforesaid tests.

“One implication is that a newcomer to India
would remain NOR for the first two financial years at least
of his stay in India. Similarly, where a person who is a
resident in India goes abroad and remains non-resident
for at least nine out of the next ten financial years, he
would on his return be treated as NOR for at least the
two financial years (the financial year of returning to
India and the immediately subsequent financial year).
