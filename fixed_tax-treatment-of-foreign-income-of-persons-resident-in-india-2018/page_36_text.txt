However, resident country would then relieve double
taxation in accordance with the provision in the DTAA
concerning this. In most of our treaty India has provided
that it would eliminate double taxation in such situation
by following credit method. That means it would allow
credit of tax paid in source country by the Indian resident
while taxing that income in India..

5.4 So far as taxation of business profits is concerned,
these agreements generally provide that the profits would
the taxed only in the country of residence of the taxpayer
unless the taxpayer has a permanent establishment in
the country in which the profits arise. The expression
‘permanent establishment’ normally means a fixed
place of business and includes certain activities which
are specified in the tax agreements. Where there is
a permanent establishment, the business profits of
the taxpayer arising in the country of source may be
taxed there. The incomes such as royalties, fees for
technical services, dividends and interest are generally
taxed in both the countries and for taxing them in the
source country there is no requirement of permanent
establishment. But in the country in which the income
arises according to the source rule, these incomes are to
be taxed at a fixed rate on gross basis. The rates of tax on
such incomes specified in India’s bilateral tax agreements
are given at Annexure ‘C’. Capital gains are generally
taxed according to the respective laws of the countries.
However, in certain tax agreements, it has been provided
that the capital gains accruing to the taxpayer in the
country of source from alienation of certain properties
will be taxed only in the country of residence.
