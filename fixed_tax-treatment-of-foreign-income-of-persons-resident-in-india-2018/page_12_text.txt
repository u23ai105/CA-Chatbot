3.3 However, in the case of a person not ordinarily
resident in India, the income which accrues or arises
to him outside India is not to be included in his total
income unless it is derived from a business controlled in
or a profession set up in India

3.4 The expressions “accrues” and “received” are to
be understood in their plain general meaning, as there
is no particular definition thereof in the Income-tax
Act. The expressions “accrues” and “arises” are used
in contradistinction to the expression “received” and
indicate a right to receive income.

Tax liability of a resident on his foreign income

3.5 The total world income of a resident is liable to
income tax in India. The foreign income i.e. income
accruing or arising outside India in any financial year is
liable to income-tax in that year even if it is not received
or brought into India. There is no escape from liability to
income-tax even if the remittance of income is restricted
by the foreign country. However, in the case of income
arising in a foreign country the laws of which prohibit
or restrict the remittance of money to India, proceedings
cannot be taken against the assessee for recovery of the
tax assessed and due in respect of such foreign income
until the prohibition or restriction is removed.

3.6 Income which has been included in the total
income of a resident on the basis that it has accrued or
arisen to him outside India, is not to be so included again
