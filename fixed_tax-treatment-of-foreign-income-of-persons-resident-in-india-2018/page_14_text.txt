activities from India. Like income derived from a business
controlled in India, income derived from a profession set
up in India is also excluded from the scope of the foreign
income. The expression “profession” includes vocation
as well. A profession established abroad and afterwards
established and continued in India would fall within the
category of a profession set up in India.

The law specifically provides that income accruing or
arising outside India is not to be deemed to be received
in India by reason only of the fact that it is taken into
account in a balance sheet prepared in India. Thus, no
amount of book-keeping or entries in the accounts kept
in India would be equivalent to receipt of income from
abroad.

3.9 Section 9 of the Income-tax Act contains provisions
in respect of income deemed to accrue or arise in India.
These are:

(i) All income accruing or arising, whether directly
or indirectly:

(a) through or from any business connection in
India;

(b) through or from any property in India;

(c) through or from any asset or source of

income in India;

(d) through the transfer of a capital asset
situated in India.
