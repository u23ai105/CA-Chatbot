3.11 Royalty

The definition of “royalty” as given in the
Explanation to Section 9(1)(vi) of the Act, is wide enough
to cover industrial; commercial copyright and equipment
royalties. Further, the definition specifically excludes
income which would be chargeable to tax under the head
“Capital Gains” and accordingly, such income is to be
charged to tax as capital gains on a net basis (i.e. after
deduction of related expenses) under the provisions of
the Income-tax Act. Royalty for this purpose includes
consideration for the transfer of any right in respect
of a patent, invention, model, design, secret formula,
or process or trademark or similar property. Royalty
also includes consideration for the use of any patent,
invention, model, design, secret formula, or process or
trademark or similar property. The provision has been
amended by the Finance Act, 2012, with retrospective
effect from 01.06.1976 to include the following:

(i) Transfer of all or any right for use (or right to
use) a computer software (including granting of
licence) irrespective of the medium through which
such right is transferred.

(ii) Any consideration in respect of any right, property
or information, whether or not :

(a) The possession or control of such right,
property or information is with the payer;

(b) Such right, property or information is used
directly by the payer;
