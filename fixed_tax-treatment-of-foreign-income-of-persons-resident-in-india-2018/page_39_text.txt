not be restricted to Rs. 1,40,000 (Rs. 2,00,000 minus
Rs. 60,000), i.e. the income under the head ‘Profits and
gains of business or profession’.

5.7 Payment of income-tax by the assessee in the
foreign country in respect of foreign income is a pre-
requisite for the grant of unilateral relief from double
taxation. Since the firm and its partners are separate
taxable entities under the Income-tax Act, a partner is
not entitled to relief in respect of his proportionate share
of the income-tax paid by the firm in a foreign country on
the income arising to it in such country.

Bar on recovery

5.8 In the case of income arising in a foreign country
the laws of which prohibit or restrict the remittance of
money to India, proceedings cannot be taken against
the assessee for recovery of the tax assessed and due in
respect of such foreign income until the prohibition or
restriction is removed.

rupees, of any income accruing or arising to or received
or deemed to be received by an assessee or on his behalf
in any foreign currency. The rate of exchange is to be the
telegraphic transfer buying rate of the foreign currency,
as on a specified date, which is adopted by the State
Bank of India. Item (2) to the Explanation to the rule
