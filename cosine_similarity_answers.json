    "question": "What are the two types of taxes levied in India?",
    "answer": "There are two types of taxes levied in India, i.e., Direct tax, which is levied directly on income, profession, etc., of an individual and where the tax burden cannot be passed on to any other person. Hence, the former is levied on the income while the latter is levied on the goods and services. INDIRECT TAXES IN INDIA \u2013 AN OVERVIEW\n\nDuring the post-Independence period, central excise duty was levied on a few commodities which were in the nature of raw materials and intermediate inputs, and consumer goods were by and large outside the purview of this duty. A report, titled \u201cReform of Domestic Trade Taxes in India,\u201d on reforming indirect taxes, especially State sales tax, by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy under the leadership of Dr. Amaresh Bagchi, was prepared in 1994. The number of rates was too many with no offsetting of taxes paid on inputs.",

    "question": "What did the Taxation Enquiry Commission suggest that sales tax should be used specifically by the States as a source of revenue?",
    "answer": "The Commission recommended that sales tax should be used specifically by the States as a source of revenue. Rates of sales tax were more than ten in some states and these varied for the same commodity in different states. Sales tax had some serious flaws. It also recommended the levy of a tax on inter-State sales subject to a ceiling of 1%, which the states would administer and also retain the revenue from it. The first set of reforms was suggested by the Taxation Enquiry Commission (1953-54). Some of the key recommendations were: replacing sales tax by VAT by moving over to a multistage system of taxation; allowing input tax credits for all inputs, including on machinery and equipment; harmonization and rationalization of tax rates across States with two or three rates within specified bands; pruning of exemptions and concessions except for a basic threshold limit and items like unprocessed food; zero rating of exports, inter-State sales, and consignment transfers to registered dealers; taxing inter-State sales to non-registered persons as local sales; modernization of tax administration, computerization of operations, and simplification of forms and procedures. Before state-level VAT was introduced by states in the first half of the first decade of this century, sales tax was levied in states since independence. Inter-State sales were subjected to levy of Central Sales Tax.",

    "question": "When was central excise duty extended to most manufactured goods?",
    "answer": "By mid-1970s, central excise duty was extended to most manufactured goods. Central excise duty was levied on a unit, called specific duty and on value, called ad valorem duty. INDIRECT TAXES IN INDIA \u2013 AN OVERVIEW\n\nDuring the post-Independence period, central excise duty was levied on a few commodities which were in the nature of raw materials and intermediate inputs, and consumer goods were by and large outside the purview of this duty. In principle, duty was payable on value addition but in the beginning, it was limited to select inputs and manufactured goods only with one-to-one correlation between input and manufactured goods for eligibility to take input tax credit. A few commodities were subjected to special excise duty.",

    "question": "What did Jha recommend converting specific rates into ad valorem rates, rate consolidation and input tax credit mechanism of value-added tax at the manufacturing level?",
    "answer": "The Indirect Taxation Enquiry Committee constituted in 1976 under Shri L.K. Jha recommended, inter alia, converting specific rates into ad valorem rates, rate consolidation and input tax credit mechanism of value-added tax at the manufacturing level (MANVAT). In 2000-01, three rates were merged into one rate called Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT). In 1999-2000, tax rates were merged into three rates, with additional rates on a few luxury goods. In 1986, the recommendation of the \u201cJha Committee on moving on to value-added tax in manufacturing was partially implemented. This was called Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT). In 2004, the Input Tax Credit scheme for CENVAT and Service Tax were merged to permit cross-utilization of credits across these taxes. Thus, the importance of an efficient tax system and reforms in the tax system cannot be undermined.

    "answer": "Gradually, over the next decade, more and more services were brought under the tax net. In the 2012 budget, a negative list approach was adopted where 17 services were out of the taxation net and all other services were subject to tax. In 1994, tax rate on three services was 5% which gradually increased and in 2017 it was 15% (including cess). Taxation of services by the Union was introduced in 1994 bringing in its ambit only three services, namely general insurance, telecommunication, and stock broking. Thus, the importance of an efficient tax system and reforms in the tax system cannot be undermined. Indirect tax, on the other hand, is not paid on the direct income of an individual person but is levied indirectly on the ultimate consumer of goods and services for consumption of goods and services.

    "answer": "Previous structure of indirect taxation in India had some challenges which needed to be addressed. Some of the challenges under the previous indirect tax structure could be attributed to: Central Excise wherein there were variable rates under Excise Duty such as 2% without CENVAT, 6%, 10%, 18%, 24%, 27%, coupled with multiple valuation system and various exemptions. Similarly, the introduction of VAT in the States has removed the cascading effect by giving set-off for tax paid on inputs as well as tax paid on previous purchases and has again been an improvement over the previous sales tax regime. State Governments also levied and collected a variety of other indirect taxes such as luxury tax, entertainment tax, entry tax etc. for which no set-off was available. This multiplicity of duties complicated the tax structure and often used to obstruct the smooth flow of tax credit. Pre-GST Tax Structure & Deficiencies\nThere are various economic factors internal as well as external due to which reforms in tax system become necessary. In April, 2008, the EC submitted a report, titled \u201cA Model and Road map for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India\u201d containing broad recommendations about the structure and design of the GST.

While input tax credit of CENVAT or additional duty of customs paid on goods was available to service providers paying Service Tax, they were unable to neutralize the State VAT or other State taxes paid on their purchase of goods. But both the CENVAT and the State VAT have certain incompleteness. In respect of taxation of goods, CENVAT was confined to the manufacturing stage and did not extend to the distribution chain beyond the factory gate. Similarly, in the State-level VAT, CENVAT load on the goods has not yet been removed and the cascading effect of that part of tax burden has remained unrelieved.

Section 220\nThe Kerala High Court has held that a Company in Liquidation cannot be deemed to be an assessee in default on the same footing as any other assessee for the purposes of Section 200 of the Income-tax Act, because the Company is under the control of a Liquidator, who acts as such, in accordance to the Companies Act. Key Points\n\nSection 178\nUntil the liquidator receives the intimation of tax liability, he is not permitted to part with the assets of the Company. Section 2(22)(c) of the Income-tax Act, any distribution made to the shareholders of the company on liquidation, to the extent to which the distribution is attributable to the accumulated profits of the company immediately before the liquidation, whether capitalized or not, would be considered as deemed dividend. If the A.O. fails to notify the tax liability within the 3 months\u2019 time period, then the demand made by the A.O. after the expiry of the statutory period of 3 months falls outside the scope of preferential payment within the meaning of Section 327 of the Act and hence, such tax liability then assumes the same preference, i.e., ranks pari passu with the claims of ordinary creditors. TAXATION OF SHARE PREMIUM\nSection 56(2)(viib) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 states that, where a company, not being a company in which the public are substantially interested, receives in any previous year, from any person being a resident, any consideration for issue of shares that exceeds the face value of such shares, the aggregate consideration received for such shares as exceeds the fair market value (FMV) of the shares, shall be chargeable to tax under the head \u201cIncome from other sources\u201d. Section 139\nIf the company fails to file the return, such eventualities could be serious in nature as the company may then lose its exemptions and the tax liabilities may then interfere with and adversely affect the claims of its creditors. The High Court of Kerala held that the provisions of Companies Act are special and those of the Income Tax Act are general and if there is an apparent conflict between the two enactments, the provisions of the Companies Act shall prevail.",

Such determined value of tax along with the interest payable under any provision of this Act for any delay in furnishing the return or any default or delay in payment of advance tax is paid before furnishing the return, and the proof of payment of such tax is attached with the return. Such amount paid before furnishing the return is known as Self-Assessment Tax. In such a case, it is immaterial that the taxable income is less than the maximum amount not chargeable to tax.",

    "answer": "[Proviso to section 234C]\n\nAdvance tax is payable by an assessee on his/its total income, which includes capital gains and casual income like income from lotteries, crossword puzzles, etc., or dividend income (other than deemed dividend as per Section 2(22)(e)). It is obligatory for an assessee to pay advance tax where the advance tax payable is Rs. 10,000 or more (Section 208). Since it is not possible for the assessee to estimate his capital gains, income from lotteries, etc., and dividend income (other than deemed dividend as per Section 2(22)(e)), it has been provided that if any such income arises after the due date for any installment, then the entire amount of tax payable (after considering tax deducted at source) on such capital gains or casual income should be paid in the remaining installments of advance tax which are due.
