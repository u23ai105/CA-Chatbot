CHAPTER-6

FORFEITURE OF EXEMPTION AND
ITS CONSEQUENCES

6.1 Section 13 mentions the circumstances under which benefit of
provisions of Section 11 and Section 12 shall not be available to an
assessee. These circumstances are listed as under :—

G) Income from property held under trust for private
religious purposes and not for the benefit of public;

(ii) Income of a charitable’® trust or institution created or
established for the benefit of a particular religious
community or caste (other than SC/ST/Backward
Classes, women and children);

(ii) Income of a charitable or religious trust or institution
under whose terms or rules any part of its income directly
or indirectly benefits the author/founder/trustee/ manager
or other such person specified under Section 13(3) (For
a list of such persons, see Annexure-V);

(iv) Income of a charitable or religious trust or institution if
any part of its income or property is used or applied during
the previous year either directly or indirectly for the
benefit of any person specified under Section 13(3);

(v) Income of a charitable or religious trust or institution, if
any of its funds are invested or continue to remain

*8This restriction will not apply to a “religious” trust or institution.

invested otherwise than in the modes specified under
Section 11(5) during the previous year (this is subject to
certain specified exceptions such as assets held as corpus,
accretions to the same by way of bonus shares,
debentures acquired under certain circumstances etc.);

(vi) Income ofa charitable trust or institution engaged in the
advancement of “any other object of general public utility”
if it involves carrying on of any trade, commerce or
business activity.

6.2 A special note may be made of the condition mentioned in
sub-para (iv) above. The Act contains very stringent provisions
barring the use of either the property or the income of a charitable
or religious trust or institution in any manner whatsoever for the
benefit of the author, founder, trustee, manager, a substantial
contributor, or even a relative of any of these persons. The rigor of
this provision needs to be well understood by assessees seeking to
claim exemption under Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. In one case,
where a charitable trust had purchased a refrigerator and kept it at
the disposal of the managing trustee while its own buildings were
not ready, and no compensation was charged from the managing
trustee, the Kerala High Court held that the trust was hit by Section
13 and was not entitled to claim exemption.”
