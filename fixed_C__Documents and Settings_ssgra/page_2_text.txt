PREFACE

A number of Non Governmental Organizations across the
world are supplementing the efforts of the Government in promoting
social welfare and economic development. Tax administrations have
also recognized the voluntary efforts of these NGOs and provided
tax incentives to those engaged in charitable activities. The present
booklet under ‘Tax Payer Information Series’ is an attempt to
educate the taxpayers in NGO sector, be it a public trust or
association or other non-profit entity, of the reliefs provided under
the Income Tax Act, 1961 for charitable activities. A part from
explaining the concept of ‘Charitable Purposes’, the booklet has
also touched upon the procedure for registration, assessment, denial
of exemptions, incentives given to the donors of the trust etc.

The booklet has been authored by Sh. Parneet Singh Sachdev,
Pr. CIT- 4, Hyderabad. It is a continuation of our earlier booklet
titled ‘Assessment of Charitable Trusts & Institutions’ which was
published in 2012, and required to be revised due to changes in the
tax provisions. Sh. Parneet Singh Sachdev has updated the booklet
incorporating all amendments made by the Finance Act, 2014.

It is hoped that this booklet will be of help to those who have
to deal with the provisions relating to the charitable trusts and
institutions.

I am sure that this updated edition will be widely used by all
the users. Any suggestion for further improvement of the booklet
is welcome.
