CHAPTER-1

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), whether public
trusts, associations, or other non-profit entities (including non-profit
companies), perform a vital role in supplementing governmental
efforts in promoting economic development and social welfare.
There is a need for such organizations not only because the
resources at the command of the government are insufficient
relative to need, but also because of their outreach and the wealth
of local knowledge they possess, all of which can fruitfully be utilized
for the benefit of society. NGOs exist in all countries, whether
developed or developing. Tax administrations the world over
recognize voluntary effort and provide incentives to genuine
charitable organizations. Most often, this is done by either partially
or fully exempting their incomes from tax, and also by providing
tax incentives to donors in order to encourage them to contribute
resources to such organizations. The Indian Income Tax Act, 1961
too incorporates several provisions to extend tax breaks and
incentives to such organizations as well as to their donors.

1.2 Recognizing the need to inform assessees as well as the general
public about taxation provisions relating to religious and charitable
trusts and institutions, which are considerably different from the
legal provisions dealing with other taxable entities such as business
concerns, the then Directorate of Income Tax (RSP&PR), published
a booklet on the subject entitled “Assessment of Charitable Trusts
& Institutions” in the year 2002 under its “Taxpayer Information
Series’.
