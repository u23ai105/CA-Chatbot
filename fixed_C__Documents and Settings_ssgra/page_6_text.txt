(vii) The Income Tax Officer (ITO); and
(viii) The Inspector of Income Tax (ITD.

2.3. As is clear from the above, outside of the seven cities where
Directors of Income Tax (Exemption) are located, the
Commissioners of Income Tax and the I-T authorities working below
them perform functions parallel to that of the Directorate within
their respective jurisdictions. In fact, the Act makes mention only
of Commissioner of Income Tax. However, the Central Board of
Direct Taxes (CBDT), in exercise of it's powers under the Act,
has authorized' the Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) to
discharge all the functions of CIT in the aforesaid cities.

CHAPTER-3
CHARITABLE PURPOSE

3.1 The expression “charitable purpose” has been defined under
Section 2(15) of the Act to include:

(a) relief of the poor,
(b) education,
(c) medical relief, and

(d) advancement of any other object of general public utility.

3.2 Prior to Assessment Year 2009-10, business income of a
charitable trust or institution was also eligible for exemption subject
to conditions that such business should be incidental to the attainment
of its objects, and that separate books of account are maintained
for such business. With effect from 01.04.2009 (i.e., from assessment
year 2009-10 onwards), however, the “advancement of any other
object of general public utility” shall not qualify as a “charitable
purpose” if the same involves the carrying on of any activity in the
nature of trade, commerce or business, or rendering of any service
in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a consideration.
This new restriction applies irrespective of the nature of use or
application of the income arising from such activity. However, the
rigour of this amendment has been reduced somewhat by a
subsequent amendment brought in by the Finance Act, 2010 (with
retrospective effect from 1-4-2009)* to the effect that the said
restriction shall not apply if the aggregate value of receipts from
such activity during the given financial year does not exceed
Rs. 25,00,000.

* wef 1-4-2009 the ceiling was ® 10,00,000. It was subsequently revised
we.f 01-04-2012 to €25,00,000.
