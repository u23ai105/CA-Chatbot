After the recent amendments, approved “research
associations” (and not necessarily “scientific” research
associations as was the case earlier) are now eligible for
notification under Section 35 and exemption from tax under
Section 10 (21). However, all such associations must be
approved by the central government for this purpose. The
restrictions which apply to a trust or institution claiming
exemption under Section 11 regarding manner of application
and accumulation of income, investment of funds, business
income etc. also apply to such research associations with
necessary modifications. For further details, please see
Chapter 10.

The procedure for seeking approval of the central
government under Section 35 is also discussed in detail in
Chapter-10 (Para-10.3 to 10.10).

The central government may reject an assessee’s application
for approval under this Section where it is not satisfied
regarding the eligibility of the assessee. The central
government may also withdraw the approval already granted
by it for the reasons discussed in Para-10.7.

central government under Section 35, can an Assessing
Officer still reject the claim of such trust or fund or
institution to exemption under Section 10 (21)?

In such cases, the Assessing Officer, if he is of the view that
the contravention of Section 10(21) has taken place, is
required to intimate the central government of the
contravention. He can complete the assessment by denying
the benefit of Section 10(21) only if the central government
withdraws the notification.
