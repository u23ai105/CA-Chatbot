3.3 Further, w.e.f. 01.04.09, preservation of environment (including
watersheds, forests and wildlife), and preservation of monuments
or places, or objects of artistic or historic interest have specifically
been included within the ambit of “charitable purpose”.

3.4 It may be added that the definition of “charitable purpose”
remains an inclusive one and is not an exhaustive or exclusive one.
In other words, purposes similar to those mentioned in the aforesaid
definition could also constitute ‘charitable purpose’ under the Act.
Courts have held that the expression ‘charitable purpose’ is
sufficiently wide in scope to include a variety of activities. For
instance, promotion of sports and games is a charitable purpose’,
as is promotion of trade and commerce, even when the beneficiaries
are confined only to a particular line of trade or commodity*. At
the same time, however, the fact that remote and indirect benefits
are derived by members of the public will not be sufficient to make
the purpose a “charitable purpose” under the Act. Mentioned below
are a few significant cases which help clarify the meaning of the
expression “charitable purpose” for the purposes of income tax.

CHARITY

3.5 The word ‘Charity’ connotes altruism in thought and action. It
involves an idea of benefiting others rather than oneself.°

3.6 A commercial concern is not an object of relief of the poor on
the ground that it provides employment. The object should provide
relief directly and not indirectly.®

3.7 For a trust to be accepted as a charitable trust for the purposes
of exemption, it is necessary that the objects should be specific so
as to confirm to the requirement of income tax law in this regard.
Where they are too wide, the trust may not qualify for exemption.’

3.8 The onus to prove that objects are of charitable nature is on
the assessee.*

RELIEF OF THE POOR

3.9 The establishment of an industrial or commercial concern
ordinarily envisages a profit making activity’ and cannot be said to
bea charitable purpose on the ground that it will provide employment
to some poor persons.!°

EDUCATION

3.10 The word ‘Education’ means training and developing the
knowledge, skill, mind and character of students by normal schooling.
Travelling also enhances knowledge, but that would not amount to
‘education’ in the context of Section 2(15)."'

3.11 The running of a private coaching institute for the purpose of
training the students to appear at certain specified examinations
upon taking specified sum from the trainees is not a charitable
purpose.!”

ADVANCEMENT OF ANY OTHER OBJECT OF
GENERAL PUBLIC UTILITY

3.12 To serve a charitable purpose, it is not necessary that the
object should be to benefit the whole of mankind or all persons ina
