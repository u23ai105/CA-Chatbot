been entered into, there will not be any MAP benefit available to
the assessee with respect to the covered transactions.

6.10 NEGOTIATION BY THE COMPETENT
AUTHORITY IN BILATERAL/MULTILATERAL APA
AND ENTERING INTOAN APA:

After receiving the draft Indian position paper the competent
authority of India will then carry out negotiation with the other
competent authority (ies) in accordance with the provision of Rule
44GA. During this process the competent authority of India will
be free to deviate from the draft Indian position paper in order to
arrive at negotiated settlement. The competent authority may
require the applicant to file additional information and may conduct
such enquiry as appropriate. The applicant will not be a part of the
negotiation between the two competent authorities but he may be
consulted for this purpose by the Indian Competent Authority. On
successful completion of negotiations, the competent authority in
India shall formalize a MAP arrangement with the competent
authority in the other country (ies) and intimate the same to the
applicant. The applicant is required to convey acceptance or
otherwise of the arrangement within 30 days of such
communication. Where the taxpayer accepts the MAP
arrangement, the competent authority in India and the applicant
shall prepare a mutually agreed draft agreement and the APA
agreement shall be entered into by the Board with the assessee
after its approval by the Central Government. On behalf of the
assessee, the APA shall be signed by the person who is competent
to sign its Income-tax Return. Terms of APA will be in accordance
with Rule 10M. Once an APA has been entered into, the competent
authority of India shall send a copy of it to the Commissioner of
Income tax having jurisdiction over the assessee.
