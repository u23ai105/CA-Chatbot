Answer:

Practically, how would a Multilateral APA work and
what would be the process given that there could be
three or more participating countries? What happens
if negotiations with one of the participating country fail
and the negotiations with other participating country/
ies yield a result? Would APA in such a situation be
converted to Unilateral or Bilateral instead of
Multilateral? Is partial withdrawal allowed?

The multilateral APA, in general, takes time as it
involves more than two competent authority
negotiations. The negotiation could be separate or may
be simultaneously. It depends on convenience of
countries involved. If negotiations with one or all
countries fail, there will always be an option for the
taxpayer to either opt for unilateral APA or even a
multilateral APA not involving the country
with which agreement could not be reached.

Can an entity request for a unilateral APA for some
international transactions and bilateral APA for other
international transactions and if so whether separate
APA processes are required to be undertaken or
separate APA applications need to be filed?

Since the APA is transaction specific, there may be no
bar in making separate request and in undertaking
separate processes. However, even by filing one
application, the taxpayer can indicate its preference of
having only unilateral APA for certain transactions and
bilateral APA for rest of the international transactions.
Such an application would, however, be required to be
filed with the Competent Authority of India i.e JS
(FT&TR-I) in respect of all the international
transactions proposed to be covered in the APA.
