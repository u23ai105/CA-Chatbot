of authorized representative must be disclosed in the request along
with sufficient information about the business operation and
international transaction in order to make any discussion meaningful.
The understanding reached on various issues in the pre-filing
consultations would be reduced in writing and a copy of the same
will be given to the applicant.

The request for pre-filing consultation is required to be in Form No
3CEC. The form is self-explanatory. However, the following
guidance is provided with respect to some of the items:

° Serial no 2 requires global structure of the applicant
group. It will be useful if this global structure is
presented in the form of flow chart/diagram. This may
be omitted, if the request is on anonymous basis.
However, in that case this detail must subsequently
be submitted with formal APA application in Form
3CED, in case that application is filed.

° Serial no 3 requires names of all the associated
enterprises with which international transactions have
either been undertaken or proposed to be undertaken.
The applicant is required to provide the names of AEs
and the nature of international transaction undertaken
in last three years or proposed to be undertaken. The
name of the associated enterprise may be omitted if
the request is on anonymous basis. However, in that
case this detail must subsequently be submitted with
formal APA application in Form 3CED, in case that
application is filed.

° Serial no 6 requires functional and risk profile of the
applicant and the associated enterprise. It will be useful
if detailed FAR analysis is provided for the applicant
and the associated enterprise with respect to the
international transaction sought to be covered in the
APA application.
