Answer: There is no fixed time line. However, the applicant and

consultations.
APA Application
12. The prescribed form for application for APA (Form

No. 3 CED) contains an exhaustive list of information
required to be filed by the taxpayer. Would all such
information be necessary or need for such information
can be discussed during pre-filing meeting?

Answer: The information as listed in the application form
are required to be provided. However, in how much
detail this information needs to be provided can be
discussed during pre-filing consultation.

13. What would be the impact of concluded or pending
MAPs/domestic litigation on APA negotiations?

Answer: The past history of a case is one of the several factors
which are looked at and discussed in the process of
negotiating an APA. It is not, therefore, mandatory that
the same position as taken in past shall guide or decide
the APA process. If the applicant believes that the facts
of his case are different to what have been understood
earlier by tax authorities or adjudicating authorities, he
may file relevant evidence/information in support of
his submission. The APA authorities would look at this
evidences/information with open mind.

14. In case of new transactions having no historic transfer
pricing issues, would the tax payer be still required to
file audit history for transactions not proposed to be
covered under the APA application?
