applicant is required to provide such information
within the time requested.

While the APA request is pending, the applicant has
an obligation to update all the material facts and
information filed along with application on a timely
basis.

Failure to provide all the requisite information for
process involved in the APA, or on requests by APA
team or the competent authority, can cause significant
delay and may result in non-finalization of APA.

Q)

The term “critical assumptions” is defined in Rule
10F(f). It means the factors and assumptions that are
so critical and significant that neither party entering
into an agreement will continue to be bound by the
agreement if any of those factors or assumptions is
changed. APA will define critical assumptions in the
agreement. These critical assumptions will depend
on the facts of each case.

Decisions about an ALP or the suitability of a
particular transfer pricing methodology would be made
on the basis of the facts existing at the time. If
particular circumstances are held as central to the
decision, any changes in them would materially affect
the ALP or the suitability of the transfer pricing
methodology or the way it would need to be applied.
These circumstances would need to be addressed by
the taxpayer and be included in the APA request in
Form No.3CED as ‘critical assumptions’. Critical
assumptions should be noted even where they are
not within the applicant’s control.
