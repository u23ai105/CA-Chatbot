Answer:

The critical assumptions would depend on the facts of
each case. As the applicant and the APA authorities
discuss any case and project future price, they need to
make some assumptions. Some of the assumptions
would be critical for arriving at a particular settlement.
These assumptions are critical assumptions.

Bilateral/ Multilateral APAs

19.

Answer:

Can a taxpayer file request for a bilateral APA with a
country where the treaty entered into by India does
not contain specific provision for corresponding
adjustment for TP disputes [i.e., Article 9(2) of OECD
Model Convention]?

The practice followed by India in MAP proceedings is
that without corresponding model article 9(2), the cases
of economic double taxation are not admitted under
MAP. The similar position will also apply to APA.
Hence, if Indiaâ€™s DTAA/DTAC with a country does
not contain model Article 9(2), India would not be able
to admit cases of economic double taxation under
bilateral APA. These cases would still be eligible to
apply for unilateral APA.

Conversion of unilateral into bilateral/multilateral

Unilateral APA into a Bilateral APA/ Multilateral APA?

A unilateral APA can be converted into bilateral APA
before finalization of the terms of the agreement and
not thereafter. Therefore, a concluded unilateral APA
cannot be converted into a bilateral APA
