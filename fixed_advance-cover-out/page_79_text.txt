The decision to opt for a unilateral APA or a bilateral
APA is to be taken by the applicant. It is a fact that
bilateral APA goes a step further than unilateral APA
in ensuring tax certainty on both sides and avoiding the
tisk of double taxation. However, there is no particular
preference for the tax administration. The applicant
may prefer unilateral for the reason that there is no
APA mechanism in the other DTAA country or for the
reason that he wants only tax certainty with India or
for any other reason.

If a taxpayer has more than one international
transaction but desires to have an APA for only one of
the transactions, can the APA Authority insist that all
the transactions should be covered. Can the APA
Authority insist that the sale of goods transaction should
also be included in the APA as it would need to
evaluate whether the pricing of goods already includes
value of IP for which royalty is charged?

There cannot be any compulsion that taxpayer should
enter into an APA in respect of all international
transactions undertaken by him. However, if one
international transaction is intrinsically linked with
another international transaction in a manner that one
cannot be benchmarked independently, the tax
administration can inform the applicant that both the
international transactions need to be covered in the
application.

The APA rules are silent on the time line for the various
steps in the APA process. Is there any target/ planned
timeline for completion of various steps of APA Process
e.g. scheduling of pre-filing meeting, filing of application
after pre-filing, conclusion of unilateral and bilateral
APA etc.? Would these matters be allowed to be
discussed at the pre-filing consultation?
