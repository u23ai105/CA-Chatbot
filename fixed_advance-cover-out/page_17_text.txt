The proof of payment towards the fee may be enclosed along
with the APA application in Form No.3 CED. Fee paid is non-
refundable except when the application is not allowed to be
proceeded with under Rule 10K.

Incase of unilateral APA, the application is required to be furnished
in triplicate to the Director General of Income Tax (International
Taxation) and in case of bilateral/multilateral APA, the application
is required to be furnished in triplicate to the competent authority
of India, i.e. Joint Secretary (FT&TR-D in the Ministry of Finance.
In case of bilateral/multilateral APA, the applicant or the AE, as
the case may be, must initiate the procedure for entering into APA
with the other country as well and furnish evidence to the
Competent Authority of India regarding the same.

The application must be filed within the time as provided in Rule
101(3). If the international transaction is of a continuing nature,
from dealings that have already occurred, the application must be
filed before the first day of the previous year relevant to the first
assessment year which the application seeks to cover. For example,
if the APA application seeks to cover five years starting from A.
yr 2014-15 to A. Yr 2018-19, the application must be filed before

filed before undertaking such transaction. For example, if the
applicant is going to purchase some raw material from its foreign
associate for the first time starting from 1 December 2012 and the
application is made before 1 December 2012, the applicant has a
choice to include A. Yr 2013-2014 as the first assessment year in
the APA application. In that case, the first condition that for A. Yr
2013-2014 the application should be filed before 1* April, 2012
shall not apply.
