Answer:

Answer:

the applicant or its representative is encouraged to
provide a thorough explanation of the proposed
international transaction in order to have a fair
understanding of the APA requirement. In addition, the
details not filed at the time of pre-filing would have to
be filed at the time of formal APA application, in case
the applicant decides to go for it.

Does the APA Authority have discretion to decline a
pre filing meeting / APA application?

A request for pre-filing consultation cannot be refused.
If a request of pre-filing is made, the meeting with
taxpayer would be there for purpose of reaching an
understanding. The APA application can be declined
only on the grounds mentioned in the Rules; like removal
of defects in the application or application not being in
accordance with the understanding reached at the time
of pre-filing meeting.

As the pre-filing discussions do not bind the APA team,
can the APA team review/ revisit its initial conclusion
on approach (assuming there is no change in facts or
difference in understanding of facts)?

Pre-filing is designed to reach a preliminary
understanding and it does not bind either the taxpayer/
applicant or the tax administration. The detailed analysis
is undertaken only after filing of APA application. The
agreement will be reached based on detailed analysis
carried out after filing of APA application.

The pre-filing application (Form No. 3CEC) requires
the applicant to explain reasons for proposing a unilateral
APA instead of bi-lateral or multi-lateral. Is this a tacit
manner to discourage unilateral APA requests? What
could be some potential responses to this question?
