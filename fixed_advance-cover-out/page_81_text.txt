Answer:

It will be useful to have the full details of audit history
so that APA authorities are aware of it. Though APA
authorities are not bound by past history, it is necessary
that they are aware of it and if the applicant is willing
to file information in relation to past history, they are in
a better frame of mind to understand and analyse this
information.

Amendments to the APA Application

15.

Answer:

Amendment to the APA application can be made
before finalization of terms of agreement and it should
not alter the nature of application. What is the stage at
which terms of the agreement would be treated as
finalized? What are the probable amendments that
would not have effect of altering the nature of the
application?

The APA process is a consultative process designed
to reach an agreement.Since taxpayer is involved in
every stage of APA process, the stage of finalization
of terms of agreement for APA would be within
knowledge of the taxpayer. The APA application can
be amended in case of unilateral APA before the draft
agreement is sent by DGIT(ntl. Taxation) to the Board
and in case of Bilateral Multilateral APA before the
MAP arrangement is sent by Competent Authority to
the Board.

The request for conversion of unilateral APA application
to bilateral or multilateral APA application will not be
taken to have the effect of altering the nature of the
original application.
