Filing fee

16.

Answer:

17.

Answer:

The filing fee is based on value of international
transaction during the period of APA. How does one
deal with a situation where the actual value at the end
of the period is more (or less) than what was envisaged
at the time of application (e.g. applicant makes a bona
fide assumption that value of transaction over proposed
APA period would be less than INR 100Cr. However,
given the business growth, in the last year of the APA
period the applicant realizes that the value could be
over INR 100 Cr)? Can this also lead to a conclusion
by the APA Authorities that taxpayer has failed to meet
the critical assumptions forming basis of APA
negotiation process?

The mere fact that the value of international transaction
happens to be more than what was earlier projected
would have no effect on the quantum of the fee which
has already been paid.

How would the fee payable for an APA application be
calculated if the transaction to be covered is part of a
number of inter-linked transactions (and the analysis is
undertaken on an aggregated basis ic. TNMM)?

If one international transaction is part of many other
inter linked international transactions, and it cannot be
separately benchmarked, all the international
transactions need to be covered in the APA and the
fee needs to be calculated accordingly.
