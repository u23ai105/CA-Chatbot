1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Transfer Pricing provisions were introduced in India in 2001
which provided for determination of arm’s length price in cases
of international transactions between associated enterprises. In
order to provide tax certainty and unanimity in approach in
international transactions between associated enterprises, the
Finance Act, 2012 has inserted sections 92CC and 92CD in the
Income Tax Act 1961 (in short ‘the Act’) introducing the provisions
of Advance Pricing Agreement (APA). The APA process is
voluntary and will supplement appeal and other Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement (DTAA or in short ‘Treaty’) mechanism
for resolving transfer pricing dispute. The legislation stipulates
that Central Board of Direct Taxes (in short ‘the Board’) can
enter into an agreement with any person, with the approval of
Central Government, determining the arm’s length price (ALP)
or specifying the manner for determination of the ALP in relation
to an international transaction to be entered into by that person.
The Board has prescribed an “Advance Pricing Agreement
Scheme” (Rules 10F to 10T of Income Tax Rules, 1962) in this
regard vide notification No. 36/2012 dated 30.08.2012. The relevant
provisions of the Act and Rules are available in the appendix of
this guidance note.
