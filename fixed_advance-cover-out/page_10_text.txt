been entered into with respect to an international transaction, the
ALP with respect to that international transaction, for the period
specified in the APA, will be determined only in accordance with
the APA. The APA once entered into shall be binding on the person
as well as the Commissioner of income tax (and his subordinate
income tax authorities) having jurisdiction over such person and
such transaction. The term of APA can be a maximum of 5 years.
There is no minimum period. However, looking into the time, money
and efforts that are expected to be spent before entering into APA,
it is likely that the application for APA would normally be for a
term which is not less than at least three years. Sections 92CC (6)
and 92CC (7) contain circumstances under which the APA will
not be binding or can be declared void ab-initio. Rule 10Q and 10R
contain circumstances under which the APA could be revised or
cancelled.

3.0 TYPES OF APAs

The APA scheme envisages three types of APAs: unilateral,
bilateral and multilateral. The choice is on the applicant to choose
a particular type of APA at the time of making the application.

Unilateral APA is an agreement between the Board and the
applicant and does not involve any agreement with the treaty partner.
It, therefore, does not guarantee the ALP or Transfer Pricing Method
(TPM), determined under an APA, being accepted by the other

country.

In bilateral APA, the applicant is required to make an application
with the competent authority of India and simultaneously the
applicant or its AE should apply to the competent authority of the
other country. The two competent authorities are required to reach
an arrangement through Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)
negotiation. This arrangement is required to be accepted by the
applicant before a bilateral APA can be entered into.
