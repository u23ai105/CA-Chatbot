covered transaction of APA, the assessing officer shall inform the
TPO about the filing of modified return in respect of that transaction.

modified return by the assessee with respect to such covered
transaction. On receipt of such communication, the Transfer Pricing
Officer shall not proceed further for auditing the covered
transaction. Similarly, if the covered transaction is pending before
the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP), the assessing officer shall

transaction. In this regard the attention is invited to Rule 10P(6)
which states that the regular audit of the covered transactions
shall not be undertaken by the TPO if an agreement has been
entered into under Rule 10L except where the agreement has been
cancelled under Rule 10R.
