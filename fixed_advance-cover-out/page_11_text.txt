In multilateral APA,the applicant is required to make an application
with the competent authority of India and simultaneously the
applicant or its AE should apply to the competent authority of the
other countries which are relevant for such a Agreement. Indian
competent authority has to reach an arrangement through MAP
with competent authorities of more than one country, before that
agreement could be offered to the applicant.The arrangement is
required to be accepted by the applicant before a multilateral APA
can be entered into.

Request for bilateral or multilateral APA can be accepted by Indian
competent authority where:

@ ~~ a tax treaty exists between India and other
country(ies) containing an article on “Mutual
Agreement Procedure”;

Gi) ‘in case of international transactions leading to
economic double taxation arising out of TP
adjustments, the said tax treaty contains provisions
similar to paragraph 2 in the article 9 as provided in
OECD model convention on “Associated
Enterprises”, and

Gi) the corresponding APA program exists in the other
country.

In unilateral APA, the applicant does not wish to involve
competent authority of any other country, and the agreement is
only between him and the Board. Since, there is no prior agreement
with the competent authority of any other country; there may be a
possibility of double taxation in unilateral APA.
