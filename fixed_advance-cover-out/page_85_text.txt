APA for transactions with Permanent Establishment

23.

Answer:

The APA rules provide for covering international
transactions. Can the taxpayers consider APA for profit
attribution to permanent establishments?

Yes, it is possible. If applicant admits having PE, he
can file APA request for profit attribution to PE.

Firewalls against Confidential information

24.

Answer:

The taxpayer may file a lot of confidential information
(factual/analysis) during the APA application/
negotiation. What are the safeguards to ensure that
such information filed by the taxpayer would not be
shared with the on field audit officers or used against
the taxpayer in regular audits?

Internationally, most countries allow sharing of APA
information with on-field audit officers. The
confidentiality provision of the Income-tax Act also
allows such sharing within the income tax
department.

Documentation requirements

25.

As per the APA rules, mere filing of an application for
an agreement under these rules does not prevent the
operation of Chapter X of the Act for determination of
ALP under that Chapter till the agreement is entered
into. Would regular documentation/ Form 3CEB
compliances be required during APA negotiation phase,
which in case of bilateral APAs may even take 2-3
years?
