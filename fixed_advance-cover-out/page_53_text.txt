into, may be revised by the Board, if.-

(a there is a change in critical assumptions or
failure to meet a condition subject to which the
agreement has been entered into;

(b) _ there is a change in law that modifies any matter
covered by the agreement but is not of the
nature which renders the agreement to be non
binding ; or

(c) there is a request from competent authority in
the other country requesting revision of
agreement, in case of bilateral or multilateral
agreement.

An agreement may be revised by the Board either
suo-moto or on request of the assessee or the
competent authority in India or the Director General
of Income Tax (International Taxation).

Except when the agreement is proposed to be revised
on the request of the assessee, the agreement shall
not be revised unless an opportunity of being heard
has been provided to the assessee and the assessee
is in agreement with the proposed revision.

In case the assessee is not in agreement with the
proposed revision the agreement may be cancelled in
accordance with rule-10R.

In case the Board is not in agreement with the request
of the assessee for revision of the agreement, the
Board shall reject the request in writing giving reason
for such rejection.
