PREFACE

To bring about certainty and uniformity with regard to
determination of arm’s length price of the international transaction,
the Finance Act, 2012 had inserted sections 92CC and 92CD in
the Income Tax Act 1961 introducing the provisions of Advance
Pricing Agreement (APA). The Ministry of Finance has notified
an “Advance Pricing Agreement Scheme” (Rules 10F to 10T of
Income Tax Rules, 1962) vide notification No.36/2012 [FNo.133/
5/2012- SO (TPL)] SO (TPL) 2005 (E), dated 30-8-2012. Since
APA is a new scheme, to increase the awareness of the taxpayers
about the APA scheme and its implementation, this booklet published
under the Tax Payers Information Series will prove to be an effective
and convenient tool to educate the taxpayers in complying with the
provisions of the Scheme.

An APA is an agreement between the Central Board of
Direct Taxes and any person, which determines, in advance, the
arm’s length price or specifies the manner of the determination of
arm’s length price (or both), in relation to an international
transaction. Hence, once APA has been entered into with respect
to an international transaction, the arm’s length price with respect
to that international transaction, for the period specified in the APA,
will be determined only in accordance with the APA. The APA
process is voluntary and will supplement appeal and other disputes
