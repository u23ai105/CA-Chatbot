The terms and conditions of the APA will specify the
critical assumptions. Critical assumptions may include
operational, legal, tax, financial, accounting and
economic conditions or assumptions.

The TPO would at time of compliance audit also
determine whether critical assumptions as mentioned
in the agreement are met.

In case of breach of critical assumptions the assessee
or the TPO should notify, at the earliest, about such
a breach to the DGIT (Int. Tax) in case of unilateral
APA or to the Competent Authority in case of
Bilateral/Multilateral APA along with supporting
documents. In these circumstances, the assessee may
request for future course of action as to whether the
APA has to be revised or cancelled.

The Board or the DGIT(int. Tax) or the competent
authority may also on its own, having noticed any
breach of critical assumptions , seek to revise the
APA or cancel the APA after due information and
consultation with the taxpayer

In case of breach of critical assumptions if the APA
cannot be revised to the acceptance of all the parties
(including the competent authority of other country/
countries) to the APA then the APA would be liable
to be cancelled.
