Since pre-filing consultation is compulsory before filing an APA
application, it is advisable for the applicant to initiate pre-filing
consultation sufficiently in advance to be able to meet the time
requirement of Rule 101(3) explained above.

The APA application is required to be in Form No 3CED. The
form is self-explanatory. However, the following guidance is
provided with respect to some of the items:

. Serial no 1(g) requires names and designation of the
authorized representatives who would be appearing
before the authorities. It would be useful if
representative files proper authorization from the
applicant.

. Serial no 13 requires multinational structure,
organizational arrangement, operation set-up,
including major transaction flows. It will be useful if
this information is presented in the form of flow chart/
diagram.

. Serial no 17 requires detailed functional analysis of
the applicant and all relevant entities with respect to
the covered transactions. It would be useful if detailed
FAR analysis is provided for the applicant and all
relevant entities with respect to the covered
transactions.

. After filing the application, a soft copy of the
application may also be provided in the first meeting
with the competent authority and the APA team.
