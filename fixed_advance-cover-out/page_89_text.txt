compliance audit is not a regular TP audit. The
purposeof compliance audit is only to ensure that the
terms of the APA have been complied with.

When would an APA come into force for an existing
transaction or a new proposed transaction?

The APA comes into force from the day it is entered
into. However, it has effect in respect of transactions
entered into or undertaken during the period for which
the APA has been entered into.

If facts and circumstances change or are likely to
undergo change, can the taxpayer file for revision of
the APA under new facts? Or would it have to cancel
the APA and file for a fresh APA, i.e. would the process
be a complete withdrawal of APA and then fresh
application for APA?

If APA has already been entered into and if any of the
critical assumption is violated for change of facts, the
APA would have to be revised or cancelled. If APA
has still not been entered into, the changed facts would
be considered before arriving at an agreement.

Regarding the visit of the APA team to the premises of
the applicant, would the APA team provide the details
of date of their visit to the applicant in advance?

Yes, the visit by APA authorities would be in
consultation with taxpayer and on a pre-agreed date
and time with sufficient notice to the taxpayer. The
purpose of visit by APA team is only to understand the
business model of the taxpayer and to ascertain the
functional profile.

The renewal procedure for an APA is the same as a
fresh APA application excluding the pre-filing
