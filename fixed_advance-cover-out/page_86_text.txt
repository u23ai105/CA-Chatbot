Answer:

26.

Answer:

Yes, the regular provisions of the Income-tax Act
will continue to have application, till APA is
concluded and modified return is filed. It is always
advisable to start the process earlier so that the
APA is concluded early.

Does the taxpayer need to maintain prescribed
transfer pricing documentation (Rule 10D) after
entering into an APA? If not, would the provisions
relating to levy of penalty for non-maintenance of
such documentation be modified accordingly?

After entering into an APA, the taxpayer is required to
maintain documents in order to satisfy the terms of the
APA. Hence, there will be less compliance burden after
entering into an APA.

Remedy against cancellation of APA

27.

Answer:

If an APA is cancelled by the Board, would there be
any mechanism to appeal against the cancellation of
the APA or would the taxpayer have only recourse to
constitutional remedies?

APA is an agreement entered into by two parties one
of which is CBDT. The rules, therefore, provide for
certain specific circumstances in which CBDT can,
after due notice to taxpayer cancel the agreement. No
appeal against decision of CBDT to cancel the
agreement has been provided in Income-tax Act.
However, there is no bar against right of a taxpayer to
take recourse to constitutional remedies.
