Yrs 2014-2015 to 2018-2019. The Agreement is signed on 31
December 2014 by which time the return of income for A. Yr
2014-2015 has already been filed in accordance with section 139
of the Act. The assessee is required to file the modified return for
A. Yr 2014-2015 by 31 March 2015. Subsequently, the APA is
revised for A. Yrs 2016-2017 to 2018-2019. The revised APA is
signed on 31 December 2016, by which time the return of A. Yr
2016-2017 has already been filed in accordance with the provision
of section 139 and in compliance of the terms of the pre-revised

effect to the terms of the revised APA.
