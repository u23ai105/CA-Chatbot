2.5.1 Surcharge and cess on tax

As per the Finance Act, 2013 in case of individuals HUF,

AOP & BOI no surcharge is leviable on the tax.
However, the
amount of income tax shall be increased by an Education and
higher Education Cess of 3% on the income tax.
This is payable by
Resident as well as Non-Resident assessees.
The deduction of tax
at source is then to be made after also taking into account the Cess
on tax so calculated.
2.5.2 Average rate of deduction

The statute enjoins the employer to compute the tax liability of
the employee on the basis of the rates in force and to deduct the
tax at the average rate computed on the basis of the same.
Thus,

the employer is required to compute at the beginning of the financial
year, the total salary income payable to an employee during the
financial year.
Further, the employer should also take into account
any other income as reported by the employee.
After considering
the incomes exempt, deductions and relief, the tax liability of the
employee should be determined on the basis of the rates in force
for the financial year.
Every month, 1/12 of this net tax liability
as computed above is required to be deducted.
2.5.3 Payment of tax by employer on non monetary
perquisite

Sections 192 (1A) & 192 (1B) of the Income Tax Act, enable
the employer at his option, to make payment of the entire tax or a
part of the tax due on non monetary perquisites given to the
employee.
The tax payable is to be determined at the average rate
of the income tax computed on the basis of rates in force and the
payment will have to be made when such tax was otherwise
deductible, i.e.
at the time of payment of income chargeable under
the head salaries, to the employee.
Further, the tax so paid shall be
deemed to be the TDS made from the salary of the employee.
However, as per proviso to section 198, this tax paid will not be
deemed to be income of the employee.
2.5.4 Revision of estimate of tax liability

As per Sub-Section 3 of Section 192 a deductor can make
adjustments for any excess or shortfall in the deduction of tax already
made during the financial year, in the subsequent deductions.
For
instance, in the case where payment of advance salary, arrears of
salary, or increase of salary, commission, bonus, etc.
has taken place,
the tax liability of the employee will increase.
Deduction of tax at
source is accordingly required to be increased.
Similarly, if the
employee makes certain investments which qualify for deduction
or rebate and furnishes the required proof which reduces the tax
