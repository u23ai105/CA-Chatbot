PREFACE

The provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 relating to Tax
Deduction at Source from Salaries are of immense importance in
the context of present scenario when TDS collections account for
almost 39% of total collection of Direct Taxes.
The Income Tax Act, 1961 provides for penalties for defaults
in respect of deduction of tax at source and deposit thereof into
Central Government account.
The law is even more strict in case
the tax has been deducted at source but not deposited into the Central
Government account in the prescribed manner.
In such a case,
besides penalties, the law provides even for prosecution.
Therefore,
the tax deductors need to be well conversant with the provisions
relating to Tax Deduction at Source.
This booklet under the TPI
series is an attempt to put forth various provisions relating to Tax
Deduction at Source from Salaries in a lucid but precise manner.
Sh.
Madhukar K. Bhagat, Addl.
CIT, Range-9, Delhi has very
painstakingly updated the booklet as per the provisions of the law
as amended upto Finance Act, 2013.
I am sure that this updated
edition will be widely accepted by the users.
Any suggestions for further improvement of the booklet would

be welcome.
