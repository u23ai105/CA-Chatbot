of the company, still the statutory responsibility to deduct tax at
source rests with the company and its principal officer thereof.
In
respect of companies, the I.T.Act Section 2(35) has specified
principal officer to mean:

(a) Secretary, Treasurer, Manager or agent of the company.
(b) Any person connected with the management or administration
of the company or upon whom the assessing officer has served
the notice of his intention to treat him as a principal officer.
2.3 TDS on simultaneous employment with more than
one employer or on change of employment

Sub-Section 2 of Section 192 provides that where a person is
simultaneously employed with more than one employer, he may
furnish the particulars of salary payments and TDS to the employer
of his choice.
Similarly, on change of employment the particulars of
salary and TDS of earlier employment may be furnished to the
subsequent employer.
These particulars are to be furnished in Form
12 B in accordance with Rule 26A of the LT.Rules.
The employer
on receipt of such information is required to take into account the
particulars of salary and TDS and then deduct tax at source
considering the aggregate salary from all sources.
2.4 When is tax to be deducted

Section 192 casts the responsibility on the employer, of tax
deduction at source, at the time of actual payment of salary to the
employee.
Unlike the provisions of TDS, pertaining to payments
other than salary where the obligation to deduct tax arises at the
time of credit or payment, which ever is earlier, the responsibility
to deduct tax from salaries arises only at the time of payment.
Thus, when advance salary and arrears of salary has been paid,
the employer has to take the same into account while computing
the tax deductible.
2.5 Rate of deduction of tax

As per Section 192, the employer is required to deduct tax at
source on the amount payable at the average rate of income tax.
This is to be computed on the basis of rates in force for the financial
Year in which payment is made.
The Finance Act of each financial year specifies the rates in
force for deduction of tax at source.
For F.Y.
2012-2013 rate of
TDS is specified in Part-3, Schedule-I of Finance Act 2012.
