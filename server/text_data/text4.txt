The taxation of income categorized under the head "Salaries" is governed by well-established principles under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. At the core of this taxation framework lies Section 15, which lays down the basis of charge for salary income. As per this provision, salary is chargeable to tax on a "due" basis or a "receipt" basis, whichever occurs earlier. This means that once salary becomes due to an employee, it becomes taxable even if actual payment is deferred to a later period. Likewise, if salary is received before it becomes due, taxation arises in the year of receipt itself. However, care is taken to avoid double taxation of the same amount. If salary has already been taxed when it became due, it will not be taxed again upon payment. Similarly, if advance salary has been taxed in the year of receipt, it will not be taxed again in the year it subsequently falls due.

The relationship between the due basis and receipt basis taxation principles is clarified further through practical scenarios. For instance, salary that becomes due during the financial year 2023-24 is taxable for that year regardless of whether it is paid within the same year or subsequently. Salary received in the financial year 2023-24, even if it pertains to future services, is taxable in 2023-24 itself. Moreover, arrears of salary relating to earlier years that had not been taxed earlier on the due basis, become taxable when received during the year. Conversely, arrears already taxed earlier will not attract tax again when subsequently received. An important point emphasized under the Act is that the employee's method of accounting is irrelevant for determining the chargeability of salary income. Regardless of whether the assessee maintains accounts on a cash or mercantile basis, the salary is taxed based on the rule of "due or receipt," whichever is earlier, as set out in Section 15.

Another fundamental concept relates to the place of accrual of salary income, governed by Section 9(1) of the Income Tax Act. Generally, salary accrues or arises at the location where the service is rendered. Thus, if services are rendered in India, the corresponding salary is deemed to accrue in India, even if payment is made abroad or post-termination of the employment contract. Furthermore, pension payments made abroad are considered income accruing in India if the pension relates to services rendered within India. Similarly, leave encashment paid outside India but for leave earned during service in India is deemed to accrue in India.

However, a specific exception exists under Section 9(1)(iii). It states that salary paid by the Government of India to Indian citizens is deemed to accrue in India even when the services are rendered outside India. This special provision applies only to the salary component, whereas allowances and perquisites associated with such employment abroad are exempt from Indian taxation under Section 10(7). The practical implication of these provisions can be understood through different cases. An Indian citizen employed by the Government of India and posted abroad will have the salary taxable in India, but allowances will remain exempt. A non-resident employee working outside India for a private employer does not have to pay Indian tax on such income. A resident and ordinarily resident individual, however, is liable to pay Indian tax on global income, including salaries earned abroad.

With the objective of simplifying the tax structure, the government introduced Section 115BAC, offering taxpayers an optional new regime with lower slab rates but fewer exemptions and deductions. Under the new regime, while certain traditional exemptions like those for retirement benefits are still allowed, many exemptions commonly availed by salaried taxpayers are denied. Exemptions such as those under Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) and House Rent Allowance (HRA) are not available to those opting for the new tax regime. Special allowances granted for expenses incurred wholly and necessarily for the discharge of duties, such as traveling and conveyance allowances, continue to enjoy exemption even under Section 115BAC. Nevertheless, allowances like Helper Allowance, Uniform Allowance, and Children Education Allowance are not exempt if the new tax regime is chosen.

Another important aspect affected under Section 115BAC relates to deductions under Section 16. While the standard deduction of â‚¹50,000 continues to be available, deductions for entertainment allowance and professional tax paid by the employee are disallowed under the new regime. Taxpayers must carefully evaluate the pros and cons of shifting to the new regime because although it offers lower rates of tax, it disallows many traditional deductions that would otherwise significantly reduce taxable income.

The Income Tax Act provides a detailed definition of salary under Section 17(1). Salary includes wages, annuity or pension, gratuity, fees, commission, perquisites, and profits in lieu of salary or wages. It also encompasses advance salary payments and payments made for leave periods not availed by the employee. Contributions by an employer to a recognized provident fund beyond a specified limit, the transferred balance of provident funds that become taxable, and contributions made to the National Pension System (NPS) are also included within the scope of salary. More recently, contributions made to the Agniveer Corpus Fund under the Agnipath scheme are specifically included within the meaning of salary as per Section 80CCH.

Allowances occupy a critical space within the salary structure. Defined broadly as fixed amounts paid periodically to meet specific expenses connected to employment, allowances are generally taxable unless specifically exempted. Their taxation occurs on a due or accrued basis, even if not actually paid in a particular year. Certain allowances are fully taxable without any exemptions. Dearness Allowance, which compensates for inflation and high cost of living, is fully taxable and is considered for retirement benefit computations like gratuity and provident fund contributions. Similarly, Fixed Medical Allowance, which provides a fixed amount for medical expenses irrespective of actual expenditure, is fully taxable.

Other common taxable allowances include Tiffin Allowance, given for refreshments, and Servant Allowance, provided for domestic help. Medical doctors in government service receiving a Non-Practicing Allowance to compensate for the prohibition on private practice are also taxed fully on such allowance. Allowances like Hill Allowance, granted for employment in hilly regions, are taxable unless the location is at or above prescribed altitudes, in which case some exemptions apply. Similarly, Warden Allowance and Proctor Allowance given to employees of educational institutions are fully taxed. Deputation Allowance paid to employees transferred to different locations temporarily is also fully taxable. Overtime Allowance, paid for extra working hours, is taxed in its entirety as part of salary income.

Beyond these, several miscellaneous allowances such as Family Allowance, Project Allowance, Marriage Allowance, Dinner Allowance, and Telephone Allowance are fully taxable and included in gross salary computation. However, some allowances are only partly taxable. One of the key exemptions available is for Leave Travel Concession under Section 10(5). It allows employees to claim exemption in respect of travel costs incurred while proceeding on leave within India, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions regarding mode and cost of travel. Importantly, exemption under LTC is restricted to travel costs alone and does not cover hotel stays or food expenses. Moreover, exemption is generally available twice in a block of four calendar years, making planning important for employees who seek to maximize tax benefits.

The overall framework of taxation of salary income under the Income Tax Act aims to strike a balance between ensuring appropriate tax collection and recognizing genuine employee expenses and benefits. In doing so, it defines salary broadly, provides for taxation based on due or receipt basis whichever occurs earlier, specifies place of accrual rules, distinguishes between types of allowances, and offers optional new tax regimes to suit varying taxpayer needs. Salaried employees, forming a significant taxpayer base in India, must keep abreast of these provisions and select the taxation route most beneficial to them.

Furthermore, a failure to correctly understand and comply with salary taxation rules can lead to adverse consequences, including penalties and interest liabilities. It is thus advisable for employees to maintain accurate documentation, such as salary slips, Form 16, travel records for claiming LTC, and other proofs required for deductions and exemptions. Changes brought about by Finance Acts and CBDT notifications also require periodic review to remain compliant and optimize tax outcomes.

As work models continue to evolve with increasing remote work, international assignments, and gig economy engagements, the complexity of salary taxation is only set to increase. Employees may also increasingly receive components like stock options, performance bonuses, and deferred salaries, all of which have their unique tax implications under current law. Awareness and proactive management of one's salary structure, supported by proper planning and expert advice where necessary, will be the key to efficient and effective tax management for employees across sectors.

The value of perquisites related to rent-free residential accommodation differs based on whether the employee is a government or a non-government employee. For a government employee, the taxable value of the perquisite is determined as the license fee based on government rules, reduced by any rent actually paid by the employee for unfurnished accommodation. If the accommodation is furnished, an additional 10% per annum of the furniture cost is added to the value of the unfurnished accommodation. In the case where furniture is hired, the actual hire charges are added instead. For a non-government employee receiving unfurnished accommodation, if the accommodation is owned by the employer, the value is determined based on the cityâ€™s population according to the 2011 census. If the city has a population of more than 40 lakhs, 10% of the employeeâ€™s salary is considered; if the population is between 15 lakhs and 40 lakhs, the value is 7.5% of salary; and for cities with less than 15 lakhs, it is 5% of salary.

 If the employer has taken the accommodation on lease, the actual lease rent paid or 10% of the employeeâ€™s salary, whichever is lower, is considered the value. For furnished accommodations, 10% of the cost of furniture or actual hire charges (if applicable) is added. Any amount recovered from the employee must be reduced from the taxable perquisite value. If accommodation is provided in a hotel, and it is not part of a transfer arrangement (within 15 days), the perquisite is valued at 24% of salary or the actual charges paid to the hotel, whichever is less, reduced by any rent paid by the employee. Moreover, when the same accommodation is provided across multiple years, the value for subsequent years is capped based on the first year's value, adjusted according to the Cost Inflation Index.

In terms of interest-free or concessional loans, the perquisite value is applicable where the loan amount exceeds INR 20,000. It is calculated as the difference between the interest charged by the State Bank of India (SBI) on the first day of the relevant previous year on the maximum outstanding monthly balance and the interest actually charged to the employee. Loans provided for medical treatment are exempt from this valuation.

Regarding the use of movable assets by an employee or any household member, if the asset is owned by the employer, 10% per annum of the actual cost of the asset is taken as the taxable value. If the asset is hired, the actual hire charges are considered. This amount is reduced by any amount paid or recovered from the employee. However, the use of laptops and computers by employees does not attract taxability under perquisite rules.

When an employer transfers movable assets to an employee, specific depreciation rates apply to determine the taxable perquisite value. In the case of computers and electronic items, 50% depreciation per annum on the written down value (WDV) method is used. For motor cars, 20% per annum WDV is applied. For other assets, a straight-line method (SLM) depreciation of 10% per annum is applied. After calculating depreciation for completed years of use, the net value is considered the taxable perquisite after adjusting any recovery made from the employee.

For provision of gas, electricity, or water, if the employer pays an outside agency for these supplies, the taxable perquisite is the amount paid. If the supply is made from employer-owned resources, the manufacturing cost per unit is considered. Any amount paid by the employee is deducted from this value to arrive at the taxable perquisite.

When an employer provides free or concessional educational facilities to employees' children, the taxable value is the amount actually expended by the employer minus any amount recovered. However, if the educational institution is owned by the employer and the monthly value of the benefit does not exceed INR 1,000, there is no taxable perquisite. Recoveries made from the employee further reduce the perquisite value.

Regarding credit card expenses incurred by employers on behalf of employees, the membership fees and annual fees form part of the taxable perquisite. However, any recovery made from the employee is deducted while calculating the taxable value. If the card is used exclusively for official purposes and proper documentation is maintained, the perquisite may not arise.

In the case of club expenditures incurred for employees, the actual cost incurred by the employer, minus any recovery from the employee, is considered taxable. However, where the employer pays for a corporate membership (initial joining fee), this amount is not considered a taxable perquisite for the employee.

The use of health clubs, sports facilities, and similar amenities provided uniformly to all employees does not attract taxability under perquisite rules. Uniformity of benefit among all employees is key to this exemption.

When it comes to sweat equity shares or Employee Stock Options (ESOPs), if the companyâ€™s shares are listed on a recognized stock exchange, the fair market value (FMV) is the average of the opening and closing price of the shares on the exercise date. If the shares are listed on multiple exchanges, the FMV from the exchange with the highest trading volume is considered. If no trading occurs on the exercise date, the closing price of the last trading day is taken into account. In cases where the companyâ€™s shares are unlisted, the FMV is determined by a merchant banker on the date of exercise or up to 180 days prior.

Finally, the perquisite valuation for motor cars provided by employers varies based on different scenarios:

If a motor car is owned or hired by the employer and is used wholly and exclusively for official purposes, there is no taxable perquisite, provided proper maintenance of logs and records are kept.

If the car is used partly for official and partly for personal purposes, and the running and maintenance costs including driverâ€™s salary are met or reimbursed by the employer, then a fixed value perquisite arises. The value is â‚¹1,800 per month (plus â‚¹900 per month if a chauffeur is provided) for cars with engine capacity up to 1.6 litres, and â‚¹2,400 per month (plus â‚¹900 per month if a chauffeur is provided) for cars exceeding 1.6 litres.

If the running and maintenance costs are borne by the employee, the perquisite is limited to â‚¹600 per month (plus â‚¹900 per month for chauffeur) for smaller cars, and â‚¹900 per month (plus â‚¹900 for chauffeur) for larger cars.

When the car is provided only for personal use, the perquisite value is the actual cost incurred by the employer, including driverâ€™s salary, minus any amount recovered from the employee.

In case of reimbursement of expenses where the car is owned by the employee, if the expenses are reimbursed for official purposes, and complete records of such expenses are maintained, no perquisite arises.

However, if reimbursement is made for personal expenses or a mixed-use car without proper documentation, the value of the benefit must be included in the taxable income accordingly.
