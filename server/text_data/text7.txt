Relief When Salary Is Paid In Arrears or Advance [Section 89]

Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, tax is calculated based on the total income that is earned or received during a particular financial year. However, there can be situations where an individual receives salary in arrears or salary in advance, or even a family pension in arrears. To ensure fair taxation in such cases where income does not pertain to the year of receipt but relates to an earlier or future period, the Act provides some relief under Section 89(1). This provision ensures that the taxpayer is not placed in a disadvantageous position by being taxed more heavily simply because of bunching of income in a particular year.

Relief under Section 89(1) is specifically available in several cases. It applies when salary is received in advance or in arrears. It also applies in cases involving gratuity, compensation received on the termination of employment, and commutation of pension. The method to calculate the relief is systematic and must be followed step by step to ensure accurate computation.

The first step in calculating relief under Section 89(1) is to calculate the tax payable on the total income of the relevant previous year in which the arrears or advance salary is received, including the amount of arrears or advance. This amount can be represented as 'X'. After this, the next step is to calculate the tax payable on the total income of the relevant previous year excluding the amount of arrears or advance salary, and this value is represented as 'Y'.

Once both tax liabilities are determined, the third step is to subtract the amount calculated in Step 2 (Y) from the amount calculated in Step 1 (X). This difference, represented as 'Z', indicates the additional tax burden due to the receipt of arrears or advance in the current year.

Following this, the fourth step is to calculate the tax payable on the total income of the year to which the arrears actually relate, including the arrears amount. This is denoted as 'A'. The fifth step is to calculate the tax payable on the total income of that earlier year excluding the arrears, denoted as 'B'.

In the sixth step, the value obtained in Step 5 (B) is subtracted from the value obtained in Step 4 (A), and the result is termed 'C'. Finally, the seventh step involves determining the excess of tax computed in Step 3 over the tax computed in Step 6. The formula to find the relief is (A-B)-(C-D). If the tax computed at Step 3 (current year differential) is greater than the tax computed at Step 7 (differential for the year to which arrears pertain), then the taxpayer is entitled to relief under Section 89. However, if the tax computed at Step 3 is less than the tax computed at Step 7, then the taxpayer will not be eligible for any relief.

To understand in a compact way, the tax liability in the previous year in which the advance or arrears are received is first computed including the advance or arrears, denoted as 'A'. Then, it is computed excluding the advance or arrears, denoted as 'B'. The differential A minus B gives the immediate extra tax burden due to the arrears or advance. Separately, the tax liability of the previous year to which such additional salary relates is also calculated first including the additional salary, denoted as 'C', and then excluding the additional salary, denoted as 'D'. The differential C minus D is computed. Finally, the relief under Section 89 is determined by subtracting (C-D) from (A-B).

Thus, Section 89 ensures that the employee does not suffer an undue additional tax liability merely because salary or pension or other benefits are paid in a lump sum at a later date or as an advance.

Deductions from Salary

In computing income under the head ‘Salary’, certain deductions are available under Section 16 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. These deductions include the Standard Deduction, Entertainment Allowance, and Professional Tax.

Under Section 16(ia), the Standard Deduction is provided. This deduction is allowed at Rs. 50,000 (fifty thousand rupees) or the amount of salary, whichever is lower. The Standard Deduction has been introduced to simplify the calculation and reduce the tax burden on salaried individuals by providing a flat deduction against salary income without any conditions or requirements.

Regarding Entertainment Allowance, under Section 16(ii), the treatment differs between government and non-government employees. In the case of non-government employees, the entire amount of entertainment allowance received is fully taxable, and no deduction is available. However, in the case of government employees, a deduction is available for the entertainment allowance received. The deduction allowed will be the least of the following three amounts: one-fifth (1/5th) of the employee’s basic salary, Rs. 5,000, or the actual entertainment allowance received. The basic salary for this purpose does not include allowances, benefits, or perquisites. It must be emphasized that entertainment allowance deduction is available only for government employees.

With respect to the Professional Tax, under Section 16(iii), it is allowed as a deduction when it is paid by the employee during the previous year. Sometimes, the professional tax is deducted from the employee's salary by the employer and paid to the government on behalf of the employee; in such a case also, the deduction is allowed. Professional Tax is a state-level tax and the amount paid as professional tax during the year is allowed as a deduction from the gross salary income.

It is pertinent to note that the deductions under Section 16(ii) (Entertainment Allowance) and Section 16(iii) (Professional Tax) are not available to assessees who have opted for taxation under the new concessional tax regime introduced under Section 115BAC of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The new tax regime offers lower slab rates but restricts most of the deductions and exemptions including those under Section 16(ii) and 16(iii). Hence, employees who choose to be taxed under Section 115BAC must carefully evaluate the implications of forgoing these deductions before exercising their option.

Thus, in summary, deductions under Section 16 play an important role in computing the taxable income under the head ‘Salary’. The standard deduction provides a flat relief to all salaried individuals, while specific deductions like entertainment allowance relief and professional tax deductions are available under defined circumstances. However, these benefits are not available to those choosing the alternate tax regime under Section 115BAC, and careful planning must be undertaken by employees while making their tax choices each year.
