In the context of employment benefits and taxation, several provisions govern the tax treatment of various facilities and perquisites provided by employers to their employees and their family members, both within India and abroad. When medical facilities are provided outside India, the employer may bear several expenses such as the medical expenses of the patient, the stay expenses of the patient along with one attendant (making a total of two persons), and travel expenses incurred for the patient and one attendant. The taxability of these expenditures depends upon specific conditions. Medical expenses incurred outside India are considered tax-free to the extent permitted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Similarly, the stay expenses for the patient and one attendant are also exempt from tax to the extent permitted by RBI. However, regarding travel expenses, a distinct rule applies: travel expenses of the patient and one attendant are tax-free only if the employee’s gross total income, before including such travel expenses, does not exceed Rs. 2,00,000.

Beyond the facilities mentioned above, there exist several other categories of tax-free perquisites that employers may provide to employees. Refreshments provided by the employer during office hours and within the office premises are fully exempt from tax liability. However, it is important to note that this exemption is not available for those taxpayers who opt for the concessional tax regime under section 115BAC of the Income Tax Act, 1961. In addition, the provision of subsidized lunch or dinner to employees by the employer is considered an exempt perquisite. Recreational facilities provided by the employer are also exempt from tax, provided that the facility is available to all employees and not restricted to a select group.

Telephone facilities installed at the residence of the employee also enjoy favorable tax treatment. The amount paid by the employer toward telephone bills, which covers both official and personal usage, is exempt from tax in the hands of the employee. Moreover, when employers provide transport facilities for commuting between the office and the residence and vice-versa, either free of charge or at a concessional rate, such facilities are also treated as tax-exempt.

The employer may also pay the premium for a personal accident insurance policy effected for the benefit of the employee. The payment of the annual premium on such a personal accident policy by the employer is considered exempt from tax. Furthermore, when an employee attends a refresher course, particularly in areas like management, and the fees for such courses are borne by the employer, the expenses incurred by the employer are tax-free perquisites in the hands of the employee.

Another category includes the provision of free rations to personnel belonging to the armed forces. The value of these free rations is entirely exempt from taxation. Similarly, if an employer provides computers or laptops to an employee for official or personal use, such equipment is considered tax-exempt provided that the ownership of the computers or laptops remains with the employer.

Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court enjoy certain specific benefits such as rent-free housing and conveyance facilities provided by the government. These facilities are fully exempt from tax. Additionally, contributions made by employers toward group insurance schemes or recognized provident funds are also granted favorable tax treatment. However, it should be noted that these contributions are subject to amendments brought about by the Finance Act, 2020.

Moving beyond perquisites, the Income Tax Act under section 17(3) provides an inclusive definition of “Profits in lieu of salary.” These payments are received by an employee either instead of or in addition to regular salary or wages. The following types of payments are treated as profits in lieu of salary:

Firstly, compensation received by an employee due to the termination of employment falls under this category. Termination could arise due to retirement, premature termination, death, or voluntary resignation. Generally, under the Income Tax Act, only revenue receipts are taxable, while capital receipts are not. However, compensation received upon termination is considered taxable even though it is in the nature of a capital receipt because the Act specifically deems it as taxable. In such cases, relief under section 89(1) may be available to the assessee, particularly where the payment received represents profit in lieu of salary.

Secondly, compensation received by an employee on the modification of the terms and conditions of employment is treated similarly. If, for instance, an employer reduces an employee’s salary and offers a lump-sum compensation, that payment will be regarded as profit in lieu of salary. Similarly, where an employee is paid remuneration either at the beginning or the end of a period of service for several years in a lump sum, such payment also falls within the purview of profits in lieu of salary.

Thirdly, any amount received by an individual before joining employment or after cessation of employment is also regarded as profits in lieu of salary. This covers amounts whether received in lump sum or in installments.

Fourthly, when an employee receives a payment from a provident fund or any other fund, such payment generally falls under profits in lieu of salary unless it is specifically exempted. Exempted payments include gratuity under section 10(10), pension under section 10(10A), House Rent Allowance (HRA) under section 10(13A), and payments from recognized provident funds or public provident funds.

Fifthly, any compensation received by an employee under a Keyman Insurance Policy, including bonuses from such policies, is treated as profit in lieu of salary.

Lastly, any other sum received by an employee from the employer, which does not fall under the categories mentioned above but still represents remuneration for employment or cessation of employment, would be treated as profit in lieu of salary.

In relation to provident funds, the treatment of contributions to and money received from provident funds varies depending on the type of fund involved. For tax purposes, provident funds are categorized into three types: Statutory Provident Funds, Recognized Provident Funds, and Unrecognized Provident Funds.

A Statutory Provident Fund refers to all provident funds set up under the Provident Funds Act, 1925. Funds established by institutions such as universities, colleges, other educational institutions, the Reserve Bank of India, the State Bank of India, and the central and state governments fall under this category. In the case of a Statutory Provident Fund, the entire amount of the employer’s contribution, without any limit, and the interest accrued thereon, is exempt from tax. This exemption applies both at the time when the contribution is made and when the accumulated balance is received by or on behalf of the employee, whether due to retirement, death, or other circumstances. This specific exemption is provided under sub-section (11) of section 10 of the Income Tax Act.

A Recognized Provident Fund includes all provident funds recognized by the Commissioner of Income Tax under Rule 3 of Part A of the Fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1961. Funds established under schemes framed under the Employees Provident Funds Act, 1952, are also treated as recognized provident funds. To attain recognition, the fund must be recognized by the Commissioner of Income Tax both at the time of its establishment and must maintain such recognition continuously. The provident funds of various public sector undertakings, semi-government bodies, companies, and organizations recognized for tax purposes fall into this category.

Regarding the tax treatment of recognized provident funds up to 31st March 2020, the employer’s contribution to the fund was not treated as income in the hands of the employee, provided the contribution did not exceed 12 percent of the employee’s salary. If the employer’s contribution exceeded this limit, the excess amount would be taxable as salary income. Additionally, interest accrued on the provident fund was exempt up to a rate of 12 percent per annum. Interest above this threshold was included in the taxable income of the employee.

With effect from 1st April 2020, the Finance Act, 2020 introduced a significant change. The employer’s contribution to recognized provident funds, approved superannuation funds, and the National Pension Scheme (NPS), together with the annual interest thereon, is now subject to a combined ceiling of Rs. 7,50,000. If the total contribution by the employer exceeds this limit in a financial year, the excess amount is treated as taxable income under the head "Salary."

Regarding the employee’s own contribution to a recognized provident fund, the amount qualifies for deduction under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Here, the term "salary" includes basic salary, dearness allowance (if the terms of employment so provide), and commission based on a fixed percentage of turnover achieved by the employee.

An Unrecognized Provident Fund, by contrast, refers to any provident fund which is neither a statutory provident fund nor a recognized provident fund nor a public provident fund. In the case of unrecognized provident funds, the employee’s contribution is not eligible for any deduction under the Income Tax Act. Contributions made by the employer and interest accrued thereon are exempt at the time the contributions are made. However, when the accumulated balance is paid out to the employee in a lump sum, the portion attributable to the employer’s contribution and the interest thereon becomes taxable as salary income. The employee’s own contribution, when refunded, is not taxable as it represents a repayment of the employee’s own money. Nevertheless, the interest earned on the employee’s contribution is taxable, but it is taxed under the head "Income from Other Sources" and not as salary income.

Thus, through various provisions detailed above, the Income Tax Act, 1961 meticulously regulates the taxation of medical facilities, other perquisites, profits in lieu of salary, and contributions to and withdrawals from different types of provident funds, ensuring clarity and compliance among employers and employees alike.
