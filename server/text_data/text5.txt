The valuation of the taxable value of perquisites concerning a motor car where the expenses are met by the employer depends on various situations regarding the ownership and use of the vehicle. If the motor car is owned or hired by the employer and is used wholly for official purposes by the employee, there is no taxable perquisite, provided that the necessary documents and records as specified in the Income Tax Rules are properly maintained by the employer. In such a case, the car’s use is regarded as purely professional, and thus no benefit accrues to the employee that warrants taxation.

On the other hand, if the car owned or hired by the employer is used wholly for personal purposes by the employee, the running and maintenance charges, the wear and tear of the vehicle, any hire charges, and the salary paid to the driver are treated as the taxable value of the perquisite. This taxable value is net of any amount recovered from the employee. In addition, depreciation is considered at the rate of 10% per annum on a straight-line method (SLM) basis to compute the overall valuation of the perquisite.

In a situation where the car is owned or hired by the employer but is used partly for official purposes and partly for personal purposes, the taxable value of the perquisite is based on the cubic capacity (cc) of the engine. If the engine capacity is up to 1.6 litres, the taxable value of the perquisite is fixed at INR 1,800 per month. If the engine capacity exceeds 1.6 litres, the taxable value rises to INR 2,400 per month. Additionally, if a chauffeur is provided along with the car, an amount of INR 900 per month is to be added to the taxable value, regardless of the engine’s capacity. It is important to note that in this case, any amount recovered from the employee is not deductible from the perquisite value calculated.

When the car is owned or hired by the employee themselves and used wholly for official purposes, again, there is no taxable perquisite, provided that proper documentation as specified in the rules is maintained by the employer. This ensures that the use remains for official tasks only, similar to the employer-owned vehicle scenario discussed earlier.

In contrast, when the car is owned or hired by the employee but used wholly for personal purposes, the actual expenditure incurred by the employer in relation to the vehicle is treated as the taxable value of the perquisite. Thus, the entire cost borne by the employer in this case is taxable in the hands of the employee.

If the car owned or hired by the employee is used partly for official purposes and partly for personal purposes, then the taxable value of the perquisite is calculated as the actual expenditure incurred by the employer, reduced by the taxable value determined based on engine capacity as explained earlier. This method ensures a fair and proportionate allocation of tax liability based on personal versus official use.

Further analyzing the valuation of taxable perquisites where the expenses are met by the employee, the framework is slightly different. If the car is owned or hired by the employer and used wholly for official purposes by the employee, again, no taxable perquisite arises, subject to the maintenance of the prescribed documentation by the employer, thereby exempting the employee from any additional tax burden.

Where the car is owned or hired by the employer and is used wholly for personal purposes by the employee, only the wear and tear costs, hire charges, and driver’s salary are treated as the taxable value of the perquisite. In this case, depreciation at 10% per annum on the straight-line method is also included to reflect the diminishing value of the asset due to use over time.

When the car is owned or hired by the employer and used partly for official and partly for personal purposes by the employee, the taxable value of the perquisite depends again on the engine capacity. If the engine capacity is up to 1.6 litres, the taxable value is set at INR 600 per month. If it exceeds 1.6 litres, the perquisite value increases to INR 900 per month. Additionally, where a chauffeur is provided, an amount of INR 900 per month is to be added to either of the two amounts. In this scenario, no deduction is allowed for any recovery made from the employee when determining the taxable value of the perquisite.

To illustrate the application of these principles, consider the case of Srinivasan, an employee of ABC Ltd. for the financial year 2023–24. Srinivasan was provided with leased accommodation, for which the hire charges amounted to INR 50,000 per month. Out of this, INR 20,000 per month was recovered from Srinivasan. Additionally, the accommodation was furnished, and the employer paid actual hire charges of INR 4,050 per month for the furniture. Furthermore, Srinivasan was provided with a Hyundai Santro car along with a chauffeur, and he also received a gift voucher worth INR 9,000 during the financial year. His salary for the purposes of perquisite valuation stood at INR 25,00,000.

To compute the taxable value of the perquisites, first, the actual lease charges for the accommodation totaled INR 6,00,000 for the year. However, as per the rules, the taxable value is capped at 15% of the salary, which amounts to INR 3,75,000. Consequently, the gross taxable value of the accommodation perquisite is INR 3,75,000. From this, the amount recovered from Srinivasan, totaling INR 2,40,000, is deducted, resulting in a taxable value of INR 1,35,000 for the unfurnished accommodation.

Since the accommodation was furnished, the actual hire charges of the furniture, amounting to INR 48,600 for the year, are added to the taxable value. Thus, the taxable value for the furnished accommodation becomes INR 1,83,600.

Regarding the motor car, since a Hyundai Santro with an engine capacity within 1.6 litres was provided and used partly for official and partly for personal purposes, the taxable perquisite value is calculated at INR 1,800 per month, amounting to INR 21,600 annually. The chauffeur’s salary perquisite of INR 900 per month adds another INR 10,800, leading to a total taxable value of INR 32,400 for the motor car perquisite.

The gift voucher worth INR 9,000 must also be included as a taxable perquisite since it exceeds the tax-exempt threshold of INR 5,000. Hence, it is fully taxable.

The total taxable value of all perquisites provided to Srinivasan for the financial year aggregates to INR 2,25,000.

It must be noted that in cases of leased accommodation, the valuation of the taxable perquisite follows the rule that the actual hire charges incurred by the employer, subject to a maximum of 25% of the employee’s salary, determine the initial taxable value. This is then reduced by the amount recovered from the employee. Additionally, where furnished accommodation is provided, the value of hired furniture must be added to the unfurnished accommodation value.

Gift vouchers or tokens provided to employees are taxable as perquisites if their value exceeds INR 5,000 during the financial year. Therefore, vigilance must be maintained regarding any additional benefits given to employees outside their regular salary.

Certain facilities provided by employers are fully exempt from being treated as taxable perquisites, provided they meet specific conditions. These facilities include medical facilities provided in India, refreshments during working hours, subsidized lunch or dinner at the workplace, recreational facilities provided uniformly to all employees, telephone facilities provided at the employee’s residence, and transportation facilities provided by the employer for commuting between home and office.

Medical facilities provided by the employer to employees and their family members enjoy different tax treatment depending on where and how they are provided. If the hospital is maintained by the employer itself, the medical facility is fully exempt from tax. Similarly, treatment at a government hospital, local authority hospital, or a hospital approved by the government or Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (CCIT) for prescribed diseases is also fully exempt from taxation. Furthermore, any premium paid by the employer for health insurance of employees under an approved scheme is fully exempt. However, if medical treatment is availed in any other manner or location not covered by the exemptions mentioned, the cost of such facilities becomes fully taxable in the hands of the employee.

Additional facilities that are generally exempt from tax include personal accident insurance premiums paid by the employer, refresher courses arranged for skill upgradation, free rations provided in certain cases such as to armed forces personnel, computers and laptops provided for official or personal use, and the employer’s contribution to group insurance schemes.

Thus, the complex framework of rules regarding the valuation of perquisites ensures that employees are taxed fairly on benefits that genuinely add to their personal wealth, while facilitating exemptions for benefits aimed at promoting well-being, efficiency, and workplace convenience.
